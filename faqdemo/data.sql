3	FAQ11 What is the best English language VW magazine(s) in England/Europe?	Wayne Bulman says, "The best by far is Total VW <a href="http://www.totalvw.co.uk">http://www.totalvw.co.uk</a>.  I once would have recommended Volks World, but they lie about how good suppliers really are." <p>Most U.S. magazines are also hesitant to criticize advertisers.

6	FAQ23 I've done some welding and now I need to replace the floorpans and heater channels. How hard is this? What about international parts suppliers?	Floor pans aren't too hard, and can be done with the body on the Bug. Heater channels are quite a bit more work, and the body has to come off.<p>I recommend using a MIG welder. An experienced Bug body repair guy has recommended MIG gas with .022 inch wire.<p>Parts should be available easily in North America, and I've heard there are good suppliers in Canada, though I don't know of any. If you find parts suppliers in your country, please drop me a note with contact info.<p>	faq23 all	1

11	FAQ10 My bug has intermittent electrical problems or smoking wiring or frayed wires.	Thing one: disconnect the ground side of the battery to completely disable the electrical system. This is a good idea to do right now. Fix the worst circuits, then see if you can put the ground terminal back on with out smoking anything.<p> You'll have to go over all the wiring, and remove anything with frayed insulation. Start with the fuse block. Important: only replace one wire at a time. Otherwise you'll never remember where they all came from.<p> New ignitions switches aren't all that much money. You can mail order most any part from the places listed at:<p> <a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a><p> There is a simple wiring diagram in "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive". The complete diagrams are in the shop manuals.<p> You'll want to buy a few different colored spools of wire, and a big collection of crimp-on terminals. Most crimp tools are very poor quality. I cleaned mine up with a Dremel tool, and it barely suffices as a wire stripper. There is a good crimping tool: Channel Lock no. 909. It is a large pliers-like crimper, with a wire cuttet in the tip. It is not a stripper. This thing is great, and really does a nice job on crimp terminals.<p>I now buy tools at Lowes more than Sears. Lowes had two good crimp tools like the Channel Lock no.909 (as well at several of the clever looking stripper/crimper combo tools that are basically trash - serious.)<p> You may need a new fuse block. All the current in the car runs to the front on that heavy red wire with the white stripe. That wire needs to be in good condition. From the engine compartment, the wires run through a channel on the driver's side. This channel may be blocked by factory  applied poly urethane foam. If so, you'll have to carefully push something through there to you can get new wires through. With my car, one of the previous owners had made a very messy hack inside the car, behind the seat, above the rear wheel arch. This was probably unnecessary. I pushed a 3/4 plastic pipe through there, and run all my new wiring in that pipe. You have to pull out the driver side back seat trim panel below the window. <p> Find each frayed or corroded wire and replace it, one at a time. The most important runs are from under the back seat to the fuse block, and from the engine comparment to under the back seat.<p> Check the frame ground, and the engine block ground. It doesn't hurt to add extra grounds, especially in the front trunk area.<p> A VOM meter and a test lamp will probably help track things down. Remember, any positive wire that touches a metal part of the car will short since the frame of the car is all grounded.<p> My guess is that you have a bad fuse block, and a few melted wires. Probably not too hard to fix. Buy those tools, get the real shop manual, and get a big batch of crimp terminals. I buy mine mostly at Lowes (a big home improvement super store). <p> Drop me a note if you have any more questions.	all faq10	1
12	FAQ 120 Doug writes: <p>I am looking at Shadows. This will be my first street bike. How will a 600 be with two riders. It will be me and my wife. Anything you can tell me will help. Some say I should get at least a 750. However when I sit on them I like the feel of the 600 better. But I am unsure of the power.<p>Thanks,<p>Doug<p>	Good timing on your note. Keep in mind that as of February 2003 I've only been riding for a year (although I'm a car nut from the second I could legally drive). Just yesterday I rode my buddy's year 2000 Triumph Tiger (855cc) a few twisty miles.<p>The VLX 600 has plenty of power. You won't wheelie or do burn outs, but I doubt you'll ever lack for power. I only ride single (one up), and I'm a small guy (5 foot 8 inches, 150 lbs). I ride around town all the time. The VLX has great acceleration - at least as good as a V8 car. At highway speeds (65 mph) it is a bit slower. Wind resistance is a huge factor. The VLX still does well, but not as well as from 0 to 45 mph. It will cruise easily at 70 mph, but it feels like a taller last gear would help. <p>The VLX is a great bike, and there are plenty of good used machines out there at good prices. You could drive it for a year or two, and trade it for almost what you paid for it. Or you might just love it and keep it for a long time. The VLX has a huge following.<p>If you want to do serious miles, I'm guessing that you'd like it, but would trade up after a year. Bigger bikes are smoother, and often handle a little better.<p>The Triumph Tiger was amazing. First, it has a TON more power. With the VLX, you can usually twist the throttle as far as you want and you won't scare yourself. No so the Tiger. Very smooth and it doesn't redline until something over 8000 rpm. Cruisers like the VLX probably redline below 6000. Second, the Tiger has better cornering manners. Cornering is more like a telepathic connection. Third, the Tiger engine is very smooth - more revs don't result in the kind of increased vibration that the VLX has. Last was the riding position. The Tiger has a kind of touring seating position where the feet take some of the pressure off the butt. Riding a modern dual/sport was a real eye opener.<p>Will you like a VLX? Sure thing. You'd like probably like a larger Shadow or maybe even a Harley Sporster. For me budget is a factor, so a 1996 VLX in really good condition for  was a great deal.<p>My butt falls asleep on the VLX after an hour. However, plenty of people tour on VLXs. They take a break every hour. No problem because the tank only holds 2.9 gallons of fuel, and 0.9 gallons of that is the reserve. You'll be fueling every 90 miles or so.<p>Did you know that the VLX is a Harley imitation, right down to the semi-single pin crank? The Honda doesn't quite have the HD "potato-patato" engine note, but it is close. The result is vibration. Around town it's cool. It feels like you really are on a great machine. At highway speeds it is just an annoying buzz. The stock exhaust note is firm, a tad loud, but not anti-social.<p>The transmission is only 4 speed. False neutrals aren't much of a problem. Once is a while I'll miss 2nd gear and end up in neutral if I don't give it a firm enough kick. Down shifting is a tad clunky. The tranny doesn't want to shift when the bike is stopped, or at very slow speeds. I down shift before I get to 5 mph. If you are stopped, a light slip of the clutch will help it drop into a lower gear. I've mindlessly stopped in 3rd gear, and had to do the clutch/downshift thing a few times to get into 1st.<p>The VLX is very reliable. The engine is a 52 degree (the angle of the V bwtween the two cylinders) V2 with 583cc. It has a chain driven overhead cam, 3 valves per cylinder. There are little valve adjustment access covers in the vavle covers. Spark control is electronic with dual coils and two spark plugs per cylinder. Water cooled means that it won't overheat, and runs at a nice constant temp no matter what the outside temp is. Not a drop of oil leaks, even after 20,000 miles. The cooling system seems solid too, however, the water pump is the lowest part of the engine. I had an email note from a gal who hit a big rock and took out her water pump. Ouch.<p>The VLX Deluxe has fancier paint, and a lot of chrome. My VLX was the right bike at the right price and just incidently is a Deluxe. I didn't think much of it, but I get compliments all the time. The chrome really makes a difference. This bike looks great.<p>The VLX is somewhat limited when it comes to accessories. Due to pricing, features, and low seat height, the VLX is often considered a beginner bike. It is a serious machine, but many long term riders end up on the larger Shadows (and other cruisers, of course). There are a better selection of accessories for the larger Shadows.<p>The pillion seat is kind of small. I don't know that I'd want to spend a lot of time up there.<p>I hope all this helps.<p>I love to hear about other people's bike (and car) experiences, so drop me a note, especially if you getting back on a bike, or are a beginner.<p>Cheers, Tom.	all vlx shadow tiger motorcycle 120 faq	1

14	FAQ 105 I have a 74 bug and am having problems with it slinging oil. I have been told that the problem could be the PCV.?!<p>I have to constantly put oil in this thing. What to do?	PCV valve is not likely on a Bug. Where is the oil come from?<p>Most likely causes:<p>- Loose oil cooler, or bad oil cooler gaskets. This can put oil mostly over the left half of the engine.<p>- Engine case halves are loose. This often covers the entire top of the engine with oil.<p>- The engine is old and tired, and your crankase breather is loose and is spewing oily air all over.<p>Sadly, fixing this stuff requires removing the engine. The good news is that if everything else is fine, you won't need a new/rebuilt engine yet. Get a couple of opinions from good mechanics, especially people who have experience with aircooled VWs.<p>You can try to wipe all the oil off, then drive and see where it shows up.<p>	all faq105	1

16	FAQ71 I see that you have emphisis on Bugs, but maybe you've heard of this particular problem in the Rabbit/cabriolets. I have a 1985 that has got me into a nut-roll.  When I bought the car; (I am now the third owner), the speedometer in the guage cluster was the only thing that worked; (in the guage cluster in the dash.  The LED display does not work, save the hight beam "blue" LED, when the lights are on high beam.  The thing is the tach doesn't work, the gas guage doesn't work and the temperature guage doesn't work.  The thing is, all three guages in the center pedestal; (directly in front of the shifter), work fine.  Oil pressure, Charging meter and temperature guage.<p>I have literally pulled the whole dash apart trying to find a bad ground or broken wire to no avail.  The really strange thing is that this car has air conditioning installed--that doesn't appear as a factory installed option, more like an after thought.<p>Can you maybe steer me in the right direction.  I have come to the conclusion that all three inoperative guages in the guage cluster must be related.  The diodes on the back of the cluster all look fine, as well, the "plastic" in-laid wiring harness [kind of a ribbon cable] on the back of the speedo/guage cluster looks fine under a magnifyer.<p>Do you have any advice on this electrical problem?<p>Chris L.	My advice on this question wasn't very specific. Below my reply, see the excellent solution Chris found. Thanks Chris!<p> <p>My answer:<p>You may need to get a shop manual to know what kind of voltages/resistance to expect on the connections to those gauges and LEDs.<p>I'd get a good used instrument cluster. If it works, great. If it doesn't then I would try creating a substitue ground, and then after that running a new wire for each effected circuit.<p>I did recently discover that the dash lights on the '91 Cabriolet (and probably most other VWs) are controlled by a relay. If the relay fails, no lights.<p>Chris' reply and solution:<p>It was nice of you to reply.  I thought I'd give you the low-down on what was actually the problem for questions that may arrise in the future for VW owners w/ this kind of problem.<p>Problem:  No tach indication/no fuel indication/no eng temp indication at the instrument cluster First, I traced every wire, every ground, every terminal lug end, source to guage<p>Found:  Minor corrosion, several questionable wires where rubbing/chaffing had occurred<p>Corrective action:  Replaced all questionable lugs, wires and terminal ends; verified grounds were clean/clear Second, verified all fuses were clean at the lug ends and that the fuses were physically indeed good Third, at my wits end, pulled the fuse box down and started "oming" wires end to end [using and ohmmeter to verify that the wires conduct] Fourth, frustrated, again, pulled the fuse box down, pulled the relays out to check them.<p>MMMMMMMM!<p>Found: Relays by the previous owner had been removed/replaced incorrectly; no. "3" was in no. "5's" position, "4" was in "3." <p>Corrective action: cleaned up the lugs on the relays and placed them in the correct position.<p>Solution: Everything works! After Action: Even though some bad wires were found and some corrosion was corrected, a whole lot of stress was going on needlessly.  For anyone in the future w/ this kind of problem I'd vote common sense.<p>(1) Check the fuses<p>(2) Check the relays w/ (against) known good ones<p>(3) Verify that everything is "where it was supposed to be in the first place," against a stock wiring diagram.  If I'd of followed those simple steps above I'd of solved my problem right away and fiddled w/questionable wires later, (under no stress), knowing what my eng. temp was, and how much fuel I had on hand.<p>Thanks for the help/response,<p>Happy Motoring!	faq71 all	1
17	FAQ102 I need to replace my steering box in my 1974 super beetle. I was wondering if you could pass on any instructions prior to me diving into the project, I heard rumors that you have to remove the gas tank.	I can't imagine doing with the tank in. I'm not familiar with the steering box on the Super Beetle, but I think most of what follows applies to all Bugs.<p>Removing the tank is not too hard, but can be time consuming. It is best done when the tank is nealy empty. I had trouble trying to get the gas out of the filler, so I removed the fuel gauge sender and siphoned the gas out that way. Getting the filler hose off is a struggle because that hose is so stiff. <p>There are probably two or three small hoses to remove.<p>Four bolts hold the tank in. You might be able to remove the fuel line by lifting the tank a few inches, or you might have to remove one of the front wheels (passenger side) to remove the fuel line rubber hose from the bottom of the tank. Replace that rubber hose. I use 1/4 unleaded fuel hose.<p>Be careful with gasoline. Be very, very careful.<p>My most common advice is to get the book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" book? It covers many major repairs, and has many, many sage hints. My review is at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html</a><p>	all FAQ102	1

2	FAQ18 My Beetle has been sitting for years. How do it get it running again?	There are many tasks necessary to get an old sitting car back on the road. If the car has been more or less dry, the engine is probably fine. However, the fuel tank and brake system may have quite a bit of rust. <p>The rubber fuel lines must be replaced. Old VWs in general have fire problems, so all rubber fuel lines should be replaced, even if the can has been on the road all these years. There are 4 fuel hose sections on a Beetle: one below the fuel tank, one behind the driver side rear wheel (alongside the transmission), and at least one going into the fuel pump, and one from the pump to the carb. Use unleaded compatible fuel line. I've used 1/4 inch which works fine. Use modern band type hose clamps.<p>Be extremely careful with gasoline. The slightest spark will set it off (even static electric sparks). Disconnect the negative battery terminal so you cannot make an electrical spark. Be aware that steel tools hitting steel parts of the car can also spark. Wear gloves. Latex gloves do not hold up well when exposed to gas. Vinyl seems better. Gasoline is causes cancer. Breathing gasoline vapor is bad for you, and at very high concentrations can kill you almost instantly. Use adequate ventilation. Don't start siphons with your mouth. Buy a decent gas siphon.<p>It helps to drain the fuel tank. This accomplishes two things: gets out the old gas, and gives you a chance to siphon any water and rust out of the tank. I pull the fuel sender out of the top of the tank. It is difficult to siphon all the gas out through the filler, especially on later model Bugs.<p>I'm not an expert in re-starting cars, but I'll share some of what I know.<p>Replace the spark plugs. While you have them out, squirt a couple of squirts of oil into the cylinders. Replace the points and condensor, or replace with an electronic points module. I used a CompuFire in my Bug, and I have a Pertronix (that I still haven't put in my BMW).<p>Change the oil. Does it have water or rust in it? (hopfully not). There is a lot to do before starting the engine, and one of those tasks is to turn the engine over by hand to get oil pumped through the engine. <p>Check the air cleaner and carb for dirt, and debris. There is a chance that when you start the car, the carb may flood.<p>Inspect all the wiring. Mice love to chew the insulation off wires. There is quite a bit of wiring under the rear seat, and sadly also quite a bit of seat padding that mice just love for nests.<p>Replace the battery.<p>At the very least you'll have to bleed the brakes until the fluid doesn't come out rusty. This could easily take a quart of brake fluid. It is likely that you'll have to replace the master cylinder and wheel cylinders.<p>Install a temperature gauge, and oil pressure gauge. VDO is fine quality, and the prices are good. See my info about the temperature sender.	faq18 old barn store stored storage rust safety safe temp	1
18	FAQ 125: What can I do for a more comfortable seat on the Honda Shadow VLX (VT600CD)? I haven't bought a Shadow yet, and I'm trying to decide if the Shadow 600 will have enough power for me.	Brad from Indiana kindly answers:<p>I got my Mustang seat from my local Honda dealer after reading a lot of reviews and talking to a couple of other riders. The Honda stock seat is in my opinion the weak point for this bike. You can buy the seat on line from Mustang. Web site is mustangseats.com. I bought the wide regal touring seat for .model 75172. I like the way they extended the passenger Pillion to give extra back support to the driver. I also ordered it because of the enlarged passenger pillion to help encourage my wife to ride with me. I looked also at the Corbin seats, but didnt like the style, also saw more positive comments on mustang seats in the reviews.<p>I am happy with the power on the 600 for my type of riding. I live in central Indiana and ride rural roads to work (30 miles). I enjoy cruising country roads at around 50 mph. I think it may need a bit more power if I was to do much interstate riding. Although it will cruise ok at 70MPH there is not enough power to accelerate out of danger if someone starts to move over on you. It really feels like it could use a 5th gear.<p>I am considering buying a used Kawasaki Nomad or a Honda Shadow 1100 in the next year or so. Harleys are just to rich for my blood. I could never understand why you would pay  for a motorcycle and then begin to rip it apart and buy another  in parts for it. <p>Brad	motorcycle motor bike vt vt600 vt600c 583 butt horsepower	1

But the left side of the carbeurator is bone dry. Have put on a new electric fuel pump. Needle valve doesn't appear to be bad. What the heck is my problem?	I'm guessing carburetor needle valve, even though you checked it. Is the float level correct? How do you know the one side is dry? Look down the carb throat (engine off and cold) with a flashlight. Move the throttle linkage. Can you see the squirt of fuel from the accellerator pump? If so, the carb has fuel.<p>I'd check the fuel pressure at the carb with a pressure gauge. <p>I've never even seen a Bug dual carb setup, so I'm going on my carb experience, and a quick glance at the Bus shop manual that a kind friend donated to me.<p>	faq44 all	1

We have the cab and chassie.  he wants to chop the top I can not find any info on this can you point me in the right direction.<p>	As far as a project, get a rust free car. Body work is a time consuming bear of a job, it requires special tools, and the car will almost certainly be off the road for the whole time. A car project is easier if you can drive the car once in a while. I'd suggest a running car, but rust free is the big thing. Mechanical repairs are usually quicker than body work, and most only require the usual tools.<p>A chop job is a HUGE complex task.

24	FAQ95 I've read about Baja suspensions, but I'm still confused about what options to choose, and the costs of things like longer trailing arms for the rear. Why don't you recommend SAW (Sway-A-Way) spring plates?	Complex questions. Look at the photos of the SAW adjustable spring plates. <p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_spring_plates.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_spring_plates.html</a><p>The adjustment isn't worth it, and because of the way the plates are built, I still had to redo them 3 times. Max rear height with stock trailing arms is about the 12 degrees that the stock CV joints are capable of. Any higher than a few inches and the camber starts going negative.<p>Adjustable front tubes is an easy choice. I do not know, but I suspect that both front and rear could be more easily adjusted using coil-over booster shocks. Especially if the coil-over spring is adjustable.<p>New trailing arms allow more rear travel. Look at the long travel sand rail suspensions for really radical height. You can make a long travel Baja Bug, and it'll cost an arm a a leg. Still, you can spend less than building a sand rail, and you get the advantages of having a sedan.<p>Last year I saw a long travel front end for the Bug. I think it was a bolt in option, and may have been priced at about .<p>I wish I had more info. Compared to the racers and sand rail builders, I'm a rank amateur. Buy a few issues of "Sand Sports" magazine. You'll see tons of ads for long travel suspension parts.<p>If you build a long travel Baja, I'd love to know how it turns out.<p>	all 95 faq95	1

The fabric is in pretty good shape, but the seat is broke down to the left.<p>What is the best way to go.  To rebuild the seat or to replace?  Who would you recommend to contact?	I'd replace. I made a trip to the junk yard and came home with 2 nice seats from a later Jetta, and a semi-rough GTI seat all for . I put the nice Jetta seats in my Golf and adapted the GTI seat (any my old Golf passenger seat) for my Bug.<p>I think the seat mounts are the same for many years of Golfs. Compare the junkyard seats to your seats (you can pull out the passenger seat and still drive to the junkyard). The seats might have the same mounts up through the mid-1990s.<p>	faq57 all	1
26	FAQ20 We are long time vw fans (my wife and I) and traded in our 86 wolfburg for a newer 99 cobalt blue bug, which we love.<p>I've been looking at it recently feeling like it needs a little something to finish it off: simple things like a little visor (like a small hat brim) at the top windshield edge. And a running board along the bottom of the doors, both of which will make it look a little "retro" which I want. Any ideas as to sources for items like this?	I've ordered a few BMW and classic Bug items from Rocky Mountain Motorworks. They also carry parts for newer VWs and for the New Beetle.

27	FAQ109 I am a new bug owner. I have a kit car with a 1974 bug engine. There is an oil temperature gauge installed and it will reach 230 degrees F. Do you believe this is too hot? I checked the fan, control flaps, changed the oil. It runs strong but I was concerned on the temp. The only thing I am thinking is the lack of air flow. It is pushing a 1929 Gazelle kit. I just installed an add-on oil filter kit.	My first reaction is to say that 230 degrees F is high, but I'm not sure. If it is high, it isn't very high.<p>I've never been able to get my gauge to work (I haven't tried too hard). Mounting my temp sender in the drain plug seemed like a good idea, but the max temp there is only about 125 degrees, so I just need to mount the temperature sender in a better location.<p>I'd guess normal is more like 200-220, but I'm not sure. I think most water cooled cars run with a water temp of somewhere between 180-220. Oil temp is probably higher than the water temp.<p>Two things: <p>- Does the oil pressure light come on when the car is hot and idling? If the oil pressure is good, that is a good sign.<p>- Are the cooling flaps opening? This is hard to tell. Look at the round accordian thing between cylinders 1 and 2 (right hand side of the engine. Check it when cold. Go for a drive. Check it when hot (don't burn yourself). It should be taller. I think it grows about 1/2 inch, and that pushes the flaps open. <p><p>	all faq109 temp temperature oil flaps thermostat	1
28	FAQ89 I own a '74 super beetle and recently I've noticed that my oil light keeps coming on no matter how many times I check and fill the oil. When i've pulled over to look and see if something is amiss I find oil slecked all over the back left rear of my car. After opening the deck lid I've noticed a rather profuse amount of oil covering almost everything. I've been looking at it to see if something has come loose,split etc..and I cant figure anything out.	Uh. Oh. It sounds like your engine is ready for a rebuild. Rebuilt engines are usually about . On my parts page I list info for Wayne Dittmann. He does great rebuilds at a much lower price than larger places. You can rebuild the engine yourself, but parts alone are in the  to  range. Avoid cheaper kits. You can send your case off to be machined by Rimco. It is fun to rebuild, but more efficient time-wise to buy a rebuilt.<p>You probably have several problems. I'm guessing the low pressure is from oil blowing around your worn main crank bearings. The oil on the outside of the engine is probably coming from the oil cooler. When I pulled out my engine, I found a couple of loose case bolts, so that the split between the two case halves was also leaking. Your oil pump might also be worn. It is also possible that your oil pressure relief valves are sticking open. Leaking oil can be fixed. Low pressure is an almost sure sign that it is time to rebuild.<p>The exception would be if you had a faulty oil pressure sender. You could check that first since it is inexpensive. You'll want to get a new sender for your rebuilt engine anyway, so it isn't a waste to replace it now.<p>	all faq89	1
29	FAQ31 What size engine can I put in my Bug or Bus?	I think that the normal 1600 cc, late model dual port, dual oil relief engine will fit in nearly all Bugs and Buses. I'm not positive, so if you have doubts, or if you have an especially old or new vehicle, you should check and engine interchange book.<p>Fitting a type IV engine is quite a bit more work. I think the transmission connection is similar (or identical) but exhaust and engine cooling are quite different. Besides, the type IV engine is special, and special means expensive.<p>You can go to 1641 cc by only changing piston and cylinders.  1776 cc needs minor engine mods, but I think this is pretty easy. Larger displacements get more complex, and make a LOT of heat. Heat kills VW engines, so if you want reliable, kee the engine size smaller.	faq31 all	1
30	FAQ35 I want to lower my Bug. Can you tell me how to do this? What problems should I watch out for?	This is a very common question, but I'm an off-road kind of guy, so I don't have much info. The VW magazines (Hot VWs, and VW Trends) often have articles related to lowering.<p>I know a couple of things from those articles.<p>When you lower the Bug, you won't be able to use fat tires. Especially in the front, tire clearance is a big problem. If  you don't lower the Bug and get the correct tires, when you turn the wheel, the front tires hit, and it makes the front end go down and jerks side ways. I read a story about a guy in California who made this mistake, and nearly crashed on the freeway!<p>Lowering the back creates problems with the rear camber. The more you lower, the worse the problem.<p>I have seen some way cool looking hydraulic systems. These have pumps and special shocks that allow you to change the ride height at any time. <p>Look for books written by Keith Seume. He has written many books about custom VW bugs.	faq35 all	1
31	FAQ78 I was reading your info on the 009 and recomendations to keep the stock vacuum advance distributor.  My 76 Australian beetle has had a 009 put in it by the previous owner, with stock 34 PICT 3 carby.  It seems to be running fine around town or on the freeway, although it's running a but rich,  I have adjusted the volume control screw but I still have carbon deposits in the tail pipes.<p>What problems do you have with the 009 around town?<p>	John Muir in his fantastic book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" reports that the 009 makes the Bug a little harder to drive. He isn't very specific there, and I always assumed that he mean it had some hesitation.<p>I had hesitation problems when the 009 was in my Bug, but I'm pretty sure that was due (at least in part) to carb and intake manifold problems.<p>From an automotive engineering point of view, the advantage of vacuum advance is better fuel economy. There are non-VW Bug cars that had mechanical advance distributors, and they all ran fine.<p>Someday, I'll do a more careful test.	all faq78	1
32	FAQ93 How to remove rear windows. <p>	George sent this hint: <p>"Just happened upon your site. I have successfully removed both side and rear windows along with saving the rubber gaskets. From inside, pull back the edge of the rubber and spray a soap solution between the rubber and body as far around the window as possible.  Then, from the inside push against the windows with your feet. Try to work the corners "loose".   The gasket should start to break loose. Wear safety glasses just in case.<p>Although awhile ago, I have done quite extensive work on the VW's. From body switches to chassis and body shorting. Engine, transaxle, front end work. Dune Buggys, you name it.<p>Sure is a good car, Still have my Roll Bar type Dune Buggy."<p>Thanks George!	all faq93	1
33	FAG65 Here's my problem. I have a 1969 Beetle that will turn over but it wont start. I thought it had to do with the fuel, so i went out and bought a new electric fuel pump. Once I put it on then it started for like 30 seconds then died. Please help me. It's my only source of transportation and I need to get to work. After replacing the fuel pump I'm out of options.	Sounds like a bad carb. It runs with fuel from the accellerator pump, but not from the idle or main jets.<p>You can test this because you may be able to keep the car running by constantly tapping the gas pedal.<p>Besides, you've already replaced the fuel pump, so that (mostly) only leaves the carb.<p>Check the boots at either end of the center section of the intake manifold. A Big vacuum leak in one or both of those boots will act like a carb problem.<p>	faq65 all	1
34	FAQ29 I'm installing 3 new gauges in my bug, temp sender, oil pressure, ammeter.  I have no idea what wires to connect where because of how different a bug is than any normal car.  do you think you could just give me a rough wire connection process?  thanks.	The Bug isn't so different. The oil pressure tap is on the side of the case, just below the distributor. There is a stock pressure sensor switch there. You need a sender compatible with your oil pressure gauge.<p>Oil temp is a problem. I've put a sender in the oil drain plate, and it doesn't measure the real oil temperature (I guess because flow near the plate is low). VDO makes a dipstick sender, but that is  alone. I'm going to strap a oil temp sender to the side of my oil filter (I have a filter oil pump on my engine). <p>The ammeter has to be wired to read the current flow to/from the battery. This means that you have to run a duplicate 4 or 6 gauge wire (very fat) from under the rear seat, up to the gauge and back. Be very careful how you mount the gauge. Any short to the back of the gauge can cause a fire very quickly. This is true of any normal ammeter setup.	faq29 all	1
35	I'm looking into getting a new 2002 Shadow VLX for around . Overall is the Shadow VLX worth the money and is it a good bike to start out on for a first time rider? <p>Also, any pro's/con's of the bike? Thanks	The 600cc Shadow VLX is a great bike. It also tops my list for beginner bikes - it is my first bike. I've confirmed this with more experienced riders too. A 250cc bike is probably too small for most people. After riding my VLX, riding a Rebel at the MSF course felt kinda dinky. I'm 5'8".<p>Pros: Post 1999 carb improvements, good solid front disk, very predictable, not top heavy (which is nice when parking), reliable, good resale value, big enough to tour, average after market parts availability (the newer bikes like the 2000 you are look at have more stuff available), water cooled engine, offset crank pin gives traditional Harley engine note with less vibration, starts and runs great even at 32 degrees F, fuel valve can stay on all the time - turn it off only for long term storage.<p>Cons: The seat position can feel cramped after just an hour, mirrors vibrate at nearly all speeds due to the imitation Harley engine design, I could wish for more aftermarket parts, especially hard cases, magazine reviews say the front disk is weak (feels fine to me), red line rpms are pretty low, there's no tach, no fuel gauge either - the trip odometer does the trick, fuel capacity is low (2.9 gallons - although this keeps the bike from being top heavy, and I need to get off the bike after an hour anyway), when you drop the bike the handlebar puts a little ding in the tank, like most bikes the turn signals aren't self canceling, manual choke is ok but it is in an odd location.<p>Not that we care what other people think, but the VLX (especially the Deluxe) is a great looking bike. I get compliments all the time. Mine had a windshield when I got it, and that makes a >huge< improvement at highway speeds. I added locking hard bags and I really like them.	all shadow vlx honda givi hard bags deluxe beginner bike	1
36	FAQ58 I've got a heck of a mess with an alternator pulley on what I think is a 74 superbeetle.   My son replaced the alternator . . . did a good job, except the pulley rubs against the face of the housing.  Is there a trick to getting the spacing . . . maybe we've lost a part.	One of the spacers may be on wrong, or out of order, or the pulley is on backward.<p>As far as I know the Super is like all the other later Beetles.

37	FAQ15 I have purchased a 71 Beetle and the bumpers are unattached. What size bolts do I need for the reattachment and will regular bolts work or do they need to be a special type that is hardened or something?	I'm not sure of the size. You don't have the old ones?<p>They don't have to be hardened, but they do have to be stove bolts. These have a square shank just below the head, and the head is smooth and rounded. The square shaft keeps the bolt from turning when you tighten it.<p>If you local hardware supplier doesn't have a metric size, just use a 3/8 or so stove bolt.<p>	faq15 all	1
38	FAQ81 From what I can find on the net, it seems you've been working on this the most.  I have a 1972 Super Beetle that I recently bought, and it has a post-production lower dash on it that has a built-in squirrel cage fan that pulls air from the regular heating system up into the defrost and heating vents in front of the car.  My problem is that the wiring hadn't been done when I got the car, and I don't know how to wire it up.  There are three wires coming from the set-up....two white and a green.  Where do I need to wire these??<p>	Somewhere there is a switch, probably with 2 connectors. The third wire is probably ground.

39	FAQ60 I just bought a 69 bug, really good shape, except the front wheels started to shimmy between 30 and 40 mph.  They feel like lose casters on a shopping cart when driving.  I can push on the front wheels and they move about a half inch back and forth.  Its not bearings, but Ive never owned a bug before so Im not sure what it is.  All I know is that it shakes the steering wheel vigorously for a few seconds until I get up to speed.  I know, its probably dangerous to drive, so I'll stop driving it for now.  I like doing car work myself, so please give me a hint of what to look for.  The last answer I got from a guy at a shop was "shocks".  But they appear to be working just fine.	This sounds like ball joints or tie rod ends.

40	FAQ101 Maybe you can help me, I tuned up my bug and it is firing in all cylinders, however it wont start.  The starter is not dragging and the coil seems to be ok. Any ideas?<p>Thank you<p>	Two things (in general) make the car run: spark and fuel.<p>If you have spark at the plugs, then there are only two spark related issues: plug wires in the wrong order and the timing being off a mile. <p>My FAQ14 might help:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s=0&o=a&findme=faq14">http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s=0&o=a&findme=faq14</a><p>Line up #1, and then make sure the firing order matches how you have the wires on the dist. cap.<p>If you had fuel before the tune up, you probably still have it. Fuel pumps do tend to suddenly fail, but it is too much coincidence that the pump would fail right when you tune up. The fuel test is to put (very carefully) about one tablespoon of gas down the carb throat. Stand back, and crank the engine. If it runs for a few seconds then dies, you have a fuel problem.<p>Remember to never put your head anywhere near the carb when cranking the car. A backfire can happen anytime, but is very likely when things are messed up. A backfire is a small explosion.<p>Do you have the "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" book? It's great, and covers the causes of Bugs that don't run (amoung other things).

41	FAQ73 Any idea why im getting fuel in the crank case?	Typically this is a leak from the bottom of the fuel pump. Remove the fuel pump and look for fuel in the spacer underneath.

42	FAQ76 My flasher stopped flashing so I got a new one.  It was the closest thing Kragen's had and it looked the same as the one in my 1969 beetle so I put it in and it doesn't work at all.  Exactly how am I supposed to connect it?  And how do I put in my new wire cover?  That's the thing in the trunk on the other side of the dashboard.	I don't have a 1969. The wiring diagram is "interesting". It seems to indicate that:<p>Flasher connection:<p> KBL connects to a blue wire with a green stripe<p>+49 connects to a black wire<p>49a connects to a dual wire black-white-green.<p>Perhaps it is the wrong flasher. Try a NAPA, Federated or AutoZone store. Of course, you can always get the correct part from the local VW dealer.<p>I've never had a real wire cover (if you mean the nice piece of cardboard that keeps your groceries out of the back of the dashboard.) I think it just lays in there.	all faq76	1
43	FAQ62 How good is the HVLP spray gun you recommend? Does it have much overspray?<p>	Even with true HVLP you'll have overspray. The usual figures for a nice HVLP is 80 to 90 percent of paint sticks to the car. That means 10 to 20 percent overspray.<p>The cheap Harbor Freight gun is pretty nice. I suspect what they now sell as an HVLP for closer to  is a little better. Gravity feed is way better than siphon feed (in my experience).<p>Key factor is: adjust paint flow to almost minimum. Paint gun instructions don't mention this, and I'm not sure it is really possible with a siphon feed gun. With low paint flow, you can use a little less air and lower air pressure and you'll get better control and less overspray.<p>I think you'd still have to hang plastic in the garage. And you always have to use adequate ventillation so you don't kill yourself with fumes.	faq62 all	1

If you just looking for wiring update, here's a rundown. At the alternator: small green wire to D+; large red wire to B+; Under rear seat, remove the generator's regulator and splice: small green wire to small blue wire (goes to speedo generator warning light); large red wire from alternator to other large red wires (ignition switch lead, and positive battery lead).

50	FAQ69 I've got a 1974 bug thats lowered with spindles and beam in the front and I've adjusted the torsion bars in the rear.  I recently bought some of those adjustable spring plates (they look identical to yours - they need that other hole drilled).  My torsion bars appear to be too long.....they stick out like yours. I was wondering about how long the splines are, measuring from the end?  Did you keep the stock torsion bars or did you swap them for 1968 bars?	I haven't measured my rear torsion bars, but they are stock for 1973. You need to have spring plates designed for the late model longer torsion bars.<p>Getting those spring plates on can be a chore. I greatly simplified the task by notching my spring plates. Notching has potential drawbacks, but it has worked very well for me.<p>The other trick to getting the torsion bar back on is to use longer spring plate retainer bolts to pull the retainer and spring plate on. If those bolts turn out to be too long, replace them one at a time with shorter bolts. Do this before tightening the whole assembly down.<p>	faq69 all	1

Actually, I don't want to force the gutter foot of the system or the roof of my car in order to fit the ordinary models, I have thought to adapt available systems. Actually I would like the roof rack system to care the roof and paint of my car that's why I am so intersted in well design systems. I would appreciate if you share your experience of installing and using roof rack in your bug. Thank you in advance.<p><p>Jonathan <p>	Jonathan,<p>I am pretty sure that is it a Yakima (a friend gave it to me.) The distance between the supports is adjustable, and the rack locks. The clamps are rubber coated, so there is very little damage. It fits really well, and is very well constructed. I recommend this rack.<p>Long term rack use with any type of rack is going to effect the paint. As far as I can tell, Yakima and Thule will cause the least damage. I suggest just keeping an eye on things, and if the paint chips, touch it up before rust can form.<p>I've used clamp-on racks for years and never had anything more serious than the rare small flake of paint worn off by the rack clamp. The Yakima design is much better than the less expensive racks/clamps.<p>	all faq112	1

54	FAQ 104 heres my problem? I have a 1972 super beetle that never gives me problems until now. Last week I started it up and it was running but a little rough,then it back fired and would not idle. I looked at the motor and the ground was flooded with oil,the oil was coming from a hose on the "AIR CLEANER"? from where you put oil in the engine. I was told this model & year has a oil bath air filter? also the air cleaner was full of oil? I took it off and started the car again,and it fired right up and ran,but the oil still was coming out that hose,also I think theres gas mixed with the oil coming out the hose,what do you think? I talked to a auto shop and they said the motor was BLOWN UP? and I need to replace the motor? if this is true and it is blown up,how come it still starts and runs?I hope you can tell me what happen and how I can fix it myself without replaceing the<p>motor?           <p>P.S. I know your behind answering problems,but this is my<p>only transportation I have,and I cant afford to put it in the shop.	If the oil is coming out of the crank case breather hose, then yes, you probably have a serious problem. Normally, there is a gentle puff of somewhat oily smelling air that comes out of the crank. When the engine gets older, the stream of crank gasses increases, and can be a little<p>smokey.<p>It never hurts to get a second opinion about something like this.<p>Even an engine with really bad compression rings might run ok. If some part were actually cracked open, it would probably run rough.<p>You could get a decent quality compression checker and check the compression, or have a good shop check it. I'm guessing that the compression on one or more cylinders is very low.<p>If you drain the oil, and remove the oil screen, is there bits of metal or junk in the screen? That is a sign that bearing shells or piston rings are coming apart, and that's bad.<p>Or you could just get a used or rebuilt engine. Sadly, you are looking at  of repairs. Doing a used engine yourself would run at least  just for a fair quality used engine. You always need a few assorted parts (gaskets mostly). Good rebuilt engine are no less than , and if you get it from the right place you can get a good one for that price (shipping is extra).	all faq104	1
55	FAQ 121: How good is the single, center mounted Weber IDF carburetor? Has anyone has experience with this setup? What about cold weather? I'm worried because we have Winter where I live, and the IDF doesn't really have a choke.	I am now recommending the Weber IDF. I don't like the DFEV on the Bug (although it is a fine carb.)<p>Marvin from Albuquerque very kindly sent several emails and photos of his new Weber IDF setup. So far he loves it. <p>Marvin says, "My son and I took a break for a while on our project because I had work during week ends that was consuming our Baja Bug time. But over the Christmas break, we installed a Weber 40 IDF and the 009 distributor with electronic ignition (good bye points). We still have a stock 1600 engine, but the carb/distributor combo made for a much smoother running engine. We were impressed."<p>As for cold weather performance, Marvin says, "In temperatures in the low twenties, it takes about 4 attempts about 5 seconds each of starting the engine, or less than 30 seconds to get it started. I let it run and keep the gas on for another 30 seconds (I guess I am not very patient) and then go on my way. It takes about 2 miles before it is running nice and smooth at the low end of the power band." <p>The DFEV (Weber progressive) has a choke and starts right away, and idles fine. However, unless you have extra manifold heating, the car will often run poorly after the choke opens - usually about 5 minutes. So the two carburetors are kind of opposite for cold weather. The IDF is harder to start, but seems run better once the engine warms up.<p>I asked about the throttle linkage.

56	FAQ79 I recently inherited a 1971 beetle, and the G light comes on in the speedometer. I'm assuming this is the generator light. What is the difference between a generator and alternator? And how do you replace the generator? The car won't hold a charge, and I need to do this quickly so I don't lose my job. Thanks for the help!	Alternators are newer, and are more efficient (that's the short answer). Switching is not too hard as things go, but if you switch you want to get a complete kit with instructions. There are some people out there selling alternator conversions with no instructions.<p>You should be able to find a rebuilt generator or alternator at the local auto parts store. If you are replacing with the same thing, just switch the wires to the same terminals. There are a few other things to know, like how to set the fan belt tension (adding or removing shims).<p>Really, you need the book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive".

57	FAQ96 Here is my dilema I feel that there may or may not be a short in the wiring somewhere in the car you tell me. I was able to start the car let it run and it would run for about 15-20 minutes then just cut out. Originally I thought maybe the generator was bad so I converted over to an alternator but the problem still exists. Is it possible that there is a short that is causing this or is it the engine itself? I know that it can't possibly be a fuel flow peoblem<p>because we have installed a clear fuel filter and electric fuel pump. I'm really frustrated cause I can't drive it I can only start it and let it idle! thanx appreciate any help you can provide. <p>	My first guess would be coil. When the spark coil is going bad it often will work cold, but stops working when it heats up a little.<p>If the fuel is fine for 15 minutes, it'll almost always be fine for hours.<p>You need John Muirs idiot's guide: "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive".

58	FAQ 126 Hi Tom. Can air conditioning be installed in a vintage VW Bug? I have serious problems with the heat, and I desperately need air conditioning in my car. <p>THANK YOU! <p>Cathy<p>	Cathy, It is possible. Aside from cost, people don't often do it because the Bug doesn't have a powerful engine, and a/c will slow you down. Of course, around town speed isn't an issue, and you can always turn off the a/c on freeway entrance ramps.<p>Btlmex.com has a kit, <a href="http://www.btlmex.com/product.asp?0=200&1=209&3=8">http://www.btlmex.com/product.asp?0=200&1=209&3=8</a><p>and there is also Vintage Air at <a href="http://www.vintageair.com/index.asp">http://www.vintageair.com/index.asp</a><p>Aside from the cost (around  for parts) you need to find a really good shop to do the installation.

59	FAQ47  I have a 1977 VW fuel injected convertible.  I believe my problem is with the electric fuel pump and/or the pump relay. I can't find where these items are located in my Bug.<p> <p>What happens is that the engine quits running after a period of time and won't start until it sits for about and hour.	Those symptoms generally fit a bad relay or fuel pump. Could be plugged filter too. Pump and relay are pretty easy to test.<p>A warning before you start: gasoline explodes and it causes cancer. Keep sparks away from gasoline, and wear gloves. Remember, that even a tool hitting a metal part of the car can make a spark, clean up any fuel spills, etc.<p>Having never personally seen a fuel injection (FI) system on a Bug, I got this info from the shop manual:<p>There is a double relay under that cover behind the right rear luggage compartment. This is all behind the rear seat backrest.<p>The fuel pump is near the right front wheel. It is a metallic cylinder near the fuel filter.<p>I think you need the shop manual. Everything I've read says the FI is reliable, and not too hard to work on. However, the shop manual is vital for testing and diagnosis.<p>The shop manual is nice.

62	FAQ37 I have a 72 superbeetle. I had the engine rebuilt to a 1641, had a oil cooler installed, and had some chrome added. (chrome fan shroud, cooling tin, pulley) Since then I can go about 30 miles or so and it overheats and goes out on me. I have to sit there a few minutes, then it starts up again. I have taken it back several times to the shop. They look at it and replace something. Last time the head was destroyed. A couple of times the engine got so hot it sucked up the valve covers gaskets and lost all my oil. Any ideas? Have you ever heard of chrome parts causing the engine to overheat? The guy working said that he took off the oil cooler and put back on a reg. black shroud. he drove it and it was fine. If you have any guesses please let me know.	Chrome doesn't cool as well as plain black engine tin, but people run chrome all the time with no problems. The VW has a reasonable excess of cooling built in.<p>I think the shop is giving you a run around. The 1641 is doesn't make any more heat than a normal 1600 cc engine. It is possible that they put a really cheap chrome tin on, and the air flow is bad. Did they use a chrome dog house fan shroud? By 1972, VW put a larger oil cooler on the Bug, and the fan shroud is larger where it covers the oil cooler, so people call it a "dog house" fan shroud.<p>You can read up on VW mechanical issues in John Muir's great book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive".

65	FAQ05 On a 1969 type 1 (Bug) Solex carb, I cant get it to idle. I soaked carb 2 times in carb cleaner and blew it out with compressor. How do I know that the idle circit is open from main jet area?	The person I wrote this review for emailed me back later: the electronic idle solenoid was clogged at the tip. <p>Thanks Dave!<p>If you can get air through the passage ways, then gas will flow there too.<p>What about the idle solenoid? This is that electronic cylinder screwed into the left hand side of the carb. This must have 12 V on it to open and allow fuel into the idle jet. When the ignition is off, this valve closes. This keep the car from having "run on" or "dieseling".<p>You might also have a big vacuum leak. Did you replace the rubber boots at the ends of the intake manifold center section?<p>Also check out John Muir's book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive".

Search Amazon and Banes and Noble.<p>I subscribe to both VW magazines, and each one has at least one technical article every month.<p>My personal philosophy is to do as much work as possible and still keep my Bug running.

68	FAQ63 I have a 70 VW Bug that I am using as my very first restoration project. I turn the key and hear a soft click when the two red lights come on. I thought it was the solenoid and starter (which I changed) and then the starter relay and still get the same click...any suggestions?	That sounds like the ignition switch. When the switch starts to go bad, it doesn't even have a good enough contact to close the solenoid. With my 1973 I need to push the key in all the way, hold the key in and turn.<p>If that helps the solution is to replace the ignition switch. It's a small part, but requires taking the steering column apart (at least it requires taking the steering column apart on the 1973 with a locking ignition switch).<p>	faq63 all	1

70	FAQ80 The fuel tank sending unit on my 71 SB has a "melted" mounting board in the reostat.  The wire wound plastic board has overheated and melted to the point that the wiper arm does not contact the wire at the "full" position.  A friend loaned me his spare for testing purposes.  It was never installed in my car but had the same damage.  We pulled a third unit from a parked 72 SB only to find it in the same condition. <p>A local VW shop suggested that I had shorted the circuit to a higher amperage line. Twelve volts is still twelve volts regardless where it comes from, so I'm seeking second opinions. One manual says to test the vibrator unit by using a voltmeter to observe the voltage switching off-then-on.  Mine appears to operate much like a flasher, with equal time on and off. This means 12V is applied to the sending unit only 50% of the time.  Should the vibrator fail and apply 12v to the unit 100% of the time this would double the time the voltage is applied , thereby doubling the heat generated in the reostat.  Could this create a "melt down"?<p>	I don't know how the SB fuel sender works, but yes, if you apply 12V constantly to a circuit that is only rated for 50% duty cycle, the circuit will melt.<p>For what it is worth, my impression is that fuel senders are low current devices. The circuit is set up with a high resistance somewhere (in my 1973 it seems to be in the gauge). Resistance lowers current flow, but leaves the voltage unchanged. In your case, it doesn't sound like it was hooked to the wrong place, but that the high resisitance part of the circuit failed and shorted (the vibrator). Perhaps. I'm just making an educated guess based on your research.<p>I wonder if this is a common Super Beetle problem?	all faq80	1
71	FAQ26 My Bug is running sluggish. What can I do to find and fix the problem?	Many poor running problems are due to vacuum leaks in the intake manifold boots. These are the rubber connections between the center section of the intake manifold (the T shaped thing the carburetor is bolted to) and the intake end sections.<p>Other causes are bad distributor breaker points and condensor, bad spark plugs, and clogged carburetor.<p>First do a tune up.<p>Diagnosis is complicated. I recommend that every Bug owner get John Muir's so-called Idiot Book titled "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive".

Thanks Pam!<p>VW has just recently issued a recall on the window regulators. At the time mine broke I was not happy with the treatment at my dealer so I called another dealer to see what they would charge and if they had the part in stock. They did have the part and said that there would be no charge because they had been instructed by their management to fix gratis, since there were so many coming in. I was certainly glad that I had called around because my dealer agreed to meet that and fixed it for free. So, if anyone asks about the window regulator in the New Beetle...<p>Happy Holidays!<p>Pam	all 119	1
73	FAQ99 I want to remove the fuel injection from my VW Bug, and change to carburetors. Where can I find out how to do this? Is it difficult?	I don't know of any books, but there is probably a description somewhere. There is probably a back issue of "VW Trends" or "Hot VWs" that describes the process. Sadly, my back issues aren't indexed and they only go back a few years. There may be a kit for the change over.<p>My one short advice: repair the FI and keep it (unless it needs more than  in parts).<p>As I write this (December 19 2001) I am thinking about putting the Bosch VW FI on my bug. Either that or going to dual carbs (single barrel carbs). If you still want to remove your system after reading this FAQ, I would be interested in your old FI system at the right price (probably cheap).<p>I don't have experience with this job, but I know some related info, and of course I've read about the Bosche FI.<p>The fuel injection (FI) is probably easier to understand than most carbs, and should give more power and better gas mileage than any carb setup. Diagnosis and repair are describes pretty well in the shop manual. I've never worked on it, but I've read a few articles about various Bosch FI systems.<p>You'll need a carb. If you get a Weber (or dual Webers) you should buy either from Redline, or from someone who is  a <p>Redline retailer (I think Fast Freddie's sells Redline parts). You'll need a manifold, and manifold end pieces. I think the end pieces are standard dual port parts. You'll also need an electric fuel pump since the FI engine cases don't have a fuel pump mount. That standard low pressure facet pump for about  is good. You might have to change the distributor. I'm not sure which distributor is on FI systems. Along with the manifold, you'll have to install heat risers, unless you use dual carbs, or live in southern California where it is always warm.<p>You'll need some gaskets, and a few assorted bolts. The parts suppliers I list at my site may have a kit for this change over. <p>	all faq99	1
74	FAQ72 I have a 1973 Beetle and the brake pedal had no pressure. I changed the rear brake line, the wheel cylinders and the master cylinder. When I bled the line it appears all of the air is out of the line and I adjusted the brakes. I still do not have any pedal pressure. Do you have any ideas on what I need to look for?	You have to bleed all the lines, even if you only work on one. Start with the rear right, then rear left, the front right, and last the front left. Do not allow the brake reservoir to run dry or you have to start all over again.<p>If you knew all that already, then read on...<p>If you bleed the front brakes first, when you go to bleed the back the pedal won't go down to the floor all the way. I ran into this problem when I accidentally got air in the system by letting the reservoir run down while bleeding the rear.<p>I opened the front bleed screw, and bled the rear again. Needless to say, this goes through a lot of brake fluid. I think it works to have the front bleed screw open just a little bit. It may also work to slacken the front brake shoe adjuster to the front wheel cylinders extend to max - just be sure the front pistons extend too far and come out. It should be fine as long as you keep the brake drums on while bleeding.<p>I wonder if the late model master cylinder is different. Even after going through a couple of gallons of brake fluid, my brakes are not as firm as pre-master cylinder replacement. I only replaced the master cylinder becuase it had started a small leak.<p>It is also possible that since I did not turn the drums, that the small ridge on the the inner edge of the drum (inner is towards the center of the car) is hanging up. It may well be that the brakes will be mushy if the brake shoes aren't adjusted correctly.<p>Still, if I pump my brake twice, the pedal is lower the second time. It doesn't go down after that. Something is still no right with my brakes, and I think it has to be the master cylinder.<p>Early cylinders had a flow restrictor on each line. Apparently, this was machined into the later model master cylinders. It is possible that you and I both have an early master cylinder, and that the parts suppliers either don't know or don't care.<p>I'm sorry I don't have a more concrete answer to the mystery. My brakes are fine, but not as good as the should be. Try my suggestion about releasing pressure on the front so the pedal will go all the way down when bleeding the rear.<p>Also, make sure you have the proper clearance on the push rod. It should have a tiny amount of play (about 1/8 inch of pedal travel, which is about 1 mm (less than 1/16 inch) of play in the master cylinder push rod. If the push rod cannot fully return, the brake cylinder pressure return won't work, and the air will never be fully pushed out.<p>	faq72 all	1
75	FAQ61 My Bug has a shake and shimmy. Usually it happens between 45 and 55 mph. What's up? This seems really dangerous.	It is dangerous and you should fix it right away.

You may have to replace most of the front end parts. Once fixed, this should be fine for a long time. I'm not an expert on the Super, but from reading the order of parts replacement is: rebalance tires, check tire pressure, front end alignment, all the rubber bushings, tie rod ends, struts, brake drums. That should fix things. People often forget to replace brake drums because they rarely cause shaking on other cars.<p>	faq61 all	1
76	FAQ108 Hi Tom, <p>Hope you can help, my Mum has a 1974 12 Beetle and the release lock inside the glove compartment will not open the bonnet (also know as the hood or luggage compartment lid). The compartment (glovebox) has come away from the body of the car and it's loose. She tells me the latch still has resistance, as I suggested a cable may have broken. In her manual it states that if the latch breaks the bonnet will not stay locked. However her boot is locked. Mum is 73 and has had the car since 1975, she is just about to have it resprayed and the MOT is due, It will fail the MOT if she cannot get it open. Can you help?<p>	This is not a very detailed answer, but sketches out the solution.<p>Try to pull what part of the cable you can reach. Sometimes if a second person pushes down on the bonnet (hood) handle, the latch releases easier.<p>If the cable really has snapped, the only solution is to cut the handle on the bonnet (hood). It takes 3 cuts. The important cut is right along the release button. With some care and some gentle bending back and forth, the pieces of the handle can be removed, and with the button free, you can make the bonnet lid release.<p>The shop doing the respray may be familiar with the process.<p>Good luck with the MOT (British car inspection), and drop me a note if you have more questions.<p>By the way, if you don't have Muir's book, get it. Loads of useful info.<p>p.s. I think the manual means that if the bonnet (hood) locking mechanism breaks, the lid won't stay down. This is true, but rather rare. Usually the cable snaps where it meets the handle in the glove compartment. In this latter case, the lid is latched, and the handle has to be cut.<p>	all faq108	1
77	I recently purchased a 1776 performance engine from Mofoco with hydraulic lifters and 1.25 scat rockers. I've got about 900 miles on the engine and have had to adjust the rockers 2 times now to keep them quiet. Mofoco told me to adjust them 1 1/2 turns past zero clearance and that should quiet them. Well I have done that but the lifters on cylinders 1 & 2 keep making noise after I run it for a day or so. Is there something else I should try like different weight oil? I am now using 10/30 weight oil and my oil pressure is around 20lbs at idle and 30lbs cruising.<p>What do you think? <p>Bill	Below is my reply, and a later response from Bill. Thanks Bill!<p>-- Bill, I'm not an expert in hydraulic lifters. I seem to recollect that when I did the head on my '64 Mustang, the lifters took an hour or two of running to pump up. However, I think I forgot to bleed the lifters before installing, which meant that I ended up tightening and loosing the lifters several times. Once, I did it with the engine running, and that was a huge mess. It may make more sense to back the adjusters off to about .006 clearance, and let the engine idle a bit in the hopes that the lifters will pump up. Let the engine cool and then adjust as normal. <p>The Bus shop manual says that VW lifters should be bled (filled with oil) prior to installing in the engine. They recommend 2 turns after the adjusting nut contacts the pushrod. Engine must be cold. <p>You might ask Mofoco if they remembered to bleed the lifters before assembling the engine. How much did your engine cost? What is your idle oil pressure? <p>10W-30 oil should be fine. <p>I'd love to hear how this turns out for you. I want hydraulic lifters in my next engine since a lot of the engine noise seems to be from the valve train. <p>Best of luck, Tom.<p>-- Bill's reply:<p>Good Morning Tom, <p>First, I want to thank you for returning my email. I have been a mechanic all my life but I still like opinions from others when I face problems. Most Websites I email are very impersonal when I have asked a question. You answer is very helpful. <p>This last weekend I spent most of it working on my bug. I found a rocker on cylinder #2 loose again so I just adjusted down once more. I asked a local VW vendor, Pozzi's, here in Sacramento about the lifters and he told me he preferred solids and hadn't had much luck keeping hydraulics quiet. I have had hydraulics in all my previous cars and have always had luck with them. So far, since I readjusted these they are quiet. I drove to work this morning on the freeway and all the valves were quiet. I agree with you that it is real nice to have a quiet valve train and I will not give up on hydraulics. I also thought I'd tell you that this engine really runs nice. I changed over to dual Kadrons this weekend from a single 2 bbl. Holley Bug spray and man what a difference. No more Holley stumble, Ha!, and no more single carbs for me. I didn't want to spend the big money for the Webers so I bought the Kadrons and found them very easy to sync and set up. I was told that these carbs are very good on the gas also. <p>I will keep you informed on my hydraulics and do recommend them. Oh, you did ask me about the oil pressure and I have a high output pump in this engine although Mofoco didn't tell me what type is in it. I run about 20-25 pounds at idle, after warm, and about 30 - 35lbs on the freeway with a HP-1 Fram filter. The engine is the Mofoco Streetwise engine they advertise all the time. I had them add the 1.25 Scat lifters with solid rocker shafts, Perfect seal rings, case taped for full flow oil and mounted an external filter, and am running a 050 Bosch distributor. The basic engine without the extras was .00. The extra's cost me another .00. Runs great!<p>Thanks again for your answer.<p>Bill <p>--<p>As a postscript, in a later note, Bill again says that he is happy with his Mofoco engine, but found that support was less than he'd like after the sale. He says that he thinks he would try to buy and engine locally before going with Mofoco again.<p>	all faq115 dfav dfev ICT solex rebuild	1
78	FAQ92 My neighbor looked at the car yesterday and said it may have either a broken rod or broken piston, and that was a big problem. I don't doubt that, but why? Just trying to avoid replacing the whole engine. Oh, BTW, the car isn't running.	A common Bug engine problem is a dropped valve. Very messy, and often cracks the piston, and may crack the cylinder head as well.<p>You need the Muir book, and maybe the shop manual. That Muir book is really great. It doesn't cover everything, but it covers what you are likely to run into, and it has diagnosis and fix procedures. See my reviews at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a><p>Pop off the valve covers and inspect the valves. If you don't see anything, carefully turn the engine over by hand.	all faq92	1
79	FAQ113 Great site, thanks! <p>A little un-related but am considering purchase of VW powered trike, 1600cc OEM new engines. Can see at www.novatrikes.com. They are in process of developing automatic trans to their trikes and also hydralic lifter model engine also. Should I wait for the automatic trans or forget it and go with manual? Any problems with auto etc.? Will be a while while they redesign frame but sticks (maual transmissions) are ready for delivery. Gear ratio has been changed on the stick transaxles from 4.12 to 3.88 to control front end lift. <p>Thanks.<p>Bob <p>	I like shifting, and the manual VW tranny is solid.<p>Are they going to offer a VW autostick auto, or an aftermarket auto tranny? I'd love to hear more about that.<p>The autostick from VW is a manual tranny with an electronically activated, vacuum controlled clutch, combined with a torque converter. It works, and people tell me they like them. Service could be an issue since they are not common. However, they are reliable from what I can tell.<p>You give up a little power with the autostick, but that won't be factor on a trike!<p>Hydraulic lifters are (as far as I can tell) good. The engine will be quieter and you won't have to do the 3000 mile valve adjustment. Hyd. lifter engines need a real oil filter, but I'd recommend that anyway.<p>Drop me a note when you get it. I'd love to hear how things turn out.<p>	all faq113	1
80	FAQ91 I've got a Devillbiss (sp?) 3/4 horsepower compressor and wonder if you have any experience with a touch up gun that would run off this?  If there's not enough air - I would get specks of paint?	Interesting question. I am far from being an expert on sprayers and compressors. <p>My guess is that a 3/4 (0.75) horsepower compressor is for air brushes and filling tires, so it probably doesn't have enough air for a touchup gun. Yes, if any paint comes out, it will probably be splatter drops.<p>I've got a 2 HP, 8 gallon tank Charge Air compressor, and it is sufficient for intermittent spraying with my (so-called) inexpensive HVLP spray gun. This is with the gun on it's lowest air use setting.<p>I tried a Devilbiss touch up gun (Incidently, I had to look up Devilbiss' web site to get the correct spelling). The instructions with the gun were lousy, so maybe I was missing something. It either just sprayed air and no paint, or made a huge stream of paint, so I ended up returning it.<p>Now that I've used a relatively nice spray gun, I discovered that one key is to adjust the paint volume very low to match air flow. This is a screw on the back that makes the nozzle open just a tiny bit, even when the trigger is fully depressed.<p>This works great on my gravity feed gun. The Devilbiss touchup gun is siphon feed, so the same trick may not work.<p>Please drop me a note if you have good luck with that touchup gun.<p>	all faq91	1
81	FAQ107 What lubricant should I use on the windshield gasket when installing a new windshield?	Hi Tom,<p>I was reading your tips on installing a volkswagen windshield. Using a soapy sloution or glass cleaner is good to lube the gasket and area before installing. <p>However, silicon spray is not good. It always stays slick, if the person driving is ever in accident the windshield will come flying out and can cause alot of injury to occupants or or anyone in the area. Also if it leaks, it can never be sealed, nothing sticks to it. I am general manager for a large autoglass company and have installed for years. This just comes from experience and not wanting anyone to get hurt. Thanks for reading my email.<p>Randy <p>--<p>Thanks for the note, Randy! I didn't realize that silicon never sets up, but it makes sense. I've used soapy water on other rubber to metal installations. Works great.	all faq107	1

83	FAQ87 Hi there Tom..i have a question...i have a 74 Beetle convertible,,when i got it..the condensor wire and the wire on the inside of the distributor...was burned up..as it grounded out and got real warm and took off all the insulation...well..i replaced the wires and put a new se of points and condensor ..still did not spark..so i replaced the coil and got spark on the distributor, when i turn it over...when i try to fire it up it starts for a second and when i release the key it dies..like there is no juice going to the coil after the key is released..i want to know if you have any ideas on what i could check..do you think it is that 4 wire relay under the back seat...tried to put 12 volts to the coil..from the pos..side of thebattery to the pos..side of the coil...when i did that..the starter engaged...my guess something must be fused t the open pos..any ideas would be much appreciated...Thanks again<p>	I'd suggest tracking down what DOES have 12V with the key in the on position, but not in the start position.<p>It sounds like a bad ignition switch.<p>I'm guessing that the starter turned over when you ran 12V from the battery to the coil because you used the wrong wire. The ignition switch in teh On position just runs 12V from the battery (actually the Pos coming off the gen/alt to the battery). It also puts 12V on a few circuits in the fuse block.<p>Track down the obvious problems first, and when they are fixes the odd problems may go away, and will certainly be easier to fix.<p>#1 is do you have 12 V at the coil with the ignition switch on.<p>Remember, the distributor is on the Neg side of the coil (I guess that's obvious, but it's worth mentioning).<p>The Muir book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" has starting diagnostic procedures, and explains some of the electric system.

Looking in differnt parts books, Whitney, Rocky Mtn. etc. I dont see anything by what I think it would be called.	On the transmission side I'd guess it is the "input shaft seal".<p>On the engine side it is the rear oil seal.<p>Just phone Rocky Mountain Motorworks (or one of the other suppliers). If the sales person can't help, most of them have tech people you can talk to.<p>Even in this electronic age I phone in all my orders.<p>Remember to make a list of parts and questions before you get on the phone. While on the phone with the salesperson, write down prices, part numbers, shipping charges, the phone number you called, date you called, saleperson's name, backorder status, etc. That little list helps keep track of orders if you have to call later.

I am unable to drive the car like this and i need the car for work every day.<p>I have changed the shock absorber (damper) but it is no better. Somebody told me it may be a the torsion bar.	It sound like you have a broken torsion bar. I've never seen a broken torsion bar, but I've had my bars out a few times. I can imagine that the car might slump a little from normal use, but a big difference means that the weaker bar has a problem. <p>Torsion bar work is tricky and can be dangerous. I strongly recommend the tool you see on my Rear Suspension pages:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_spring_plates.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_spring_plates.html</a><p>Other than the torsion bar tool, everything else is normal hand tools.

89	FAQ97 I just bought a 69 Beetle with a BMW engine installed in it. There is a roar in the left rear of the little thing...especially when I put it in neutral. It comes and goes but mostly comes...is this a bearing or the axle going out to the wheel...or? ...Or?....OR?...<p> I'm a "renewed " Bug fellow but now I'm 51 and don't remember much of my youthful years fixing these problems. Please let me know something when you find the time. I thank you very much for your time and info!<p>	A BMW engine? What kind of BMW engine?<p>Bad wheel bearings roar, and it gets louder with speed of the car. It should not be effected (much) by what gear you are in, or by the engine rpms.<p>CV joints tend to 'knock' and the speed of the knocking increases as the speed of the car goes up.<p>If you're going to do the work yourself see my book reviews, tool info, and mail order parts suppliers:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a><p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_tools.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_tools.html</a><p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_orders.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_orders.html</a><p>I think I forgot to mention it on the tools page, but disposable latex gloves make car work much more fun.

It's a big job, but doable.<p>It might be easiest to replace the defroster flex tubes with the body off. I've done that with the body on, and it's a tight squeeze. I used that aluminium/mylar flex tube like people use between the fan shroud and heat exchangers.

95	FAQ66 I have a 1975 super beetle with fuel injection. My question is that it take me anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes just to get my bug to idle good, after that it runs fine. If it sits for about an hour I have to start the whole process over again. my spark plugs are good, wires are good, air filter etc.help. I miss driving my bug.	Fuel injections (FI) systems all have a temperatoure sensitive switch to make the system enrich the mixture when the engine is cold. The Bug FI systems have a thermo-time switch (temp and a timer together). It sounds like yours may be bad. I only know this from reading the shop manual. The VW dealer or a shop that knows Bosch FI should be able to diagnose the problem quickly, although they'll have to wait until yoru car is cold. I think the part is inexpensive.<p>If you are interested in the shop manual, see my review online at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0837600960.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0837600960.html</a><p>	faq66 all	1

Runs great after you get through that.<p>Any ideas on where to look/change?	I had a similar problem. I think the causes were:<p>1) Carb not adjusted by the correct procedure. See:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s2=0&o=a&findme=faq01">http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s2=0&o=a&findme=faq01</a><p>2) Timing advanced too much.<p>3) Intake manifold too cold.<p>Draw heated air from around the cylinders, make sure your thermostat flaps are working, make sure your exhaust risers are working. I'm pretty sure the the exhaust risers are mostly useless on aftermarket merged exhaust systems.<p>The cold intake is a serious problem with the VW design. I'm about to change over to dual carbs (probably the single barrel Kadrons, Solex's, or Webers). In Winter, or wet, cool weather the problem is worse. <p>	faq54 all	1
98	FAQ70 I have a 1999 New Beetle. On the drivers side of the car i have had to replace the bulb three time in the last 2 years plus once on the other side each time it has cost me .00. The dealer claims it's because it is a very hard job. My question: is there a way I can change this myself? Plus the fog lights on the bottom of the car have not worked for awhile. Is this a common problem with the New Beetles?   I do use it alot and do need the lights as everyone does, right now it has 90,000. miles on it.  Any information will be greatly appreciated.	I haven't seen the headlight assembly on the New Beetle. Most newer cars have easily accessible headlights. Usually, the bulb base just twists, and out it comes. It is a bayonette base. Be sure NOT to touch the new quartz bulb with your skin. Minute amounts of skin oil will cause the bulbs to fail quickly.<p>With all that said, headlights on the NB might be hard to replace.<p>I have heard from a few owners that changing the fog lights is expensive, and presumably time consuming (and perhaps difficult).<p>Now that you know what little I do, I'd suggest to keep searching for a NB speciality web site.<p>Incidently, Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries new VW parts. They might have info or instructions for headlight replacement. <p><a href="http://motorworks.com/">http://motorworks.com/</a><p>	faq70 all	1

Well those aren't holding anymore & I was going to try to put bolts through the hole with nuts & washers on the back (could be a problem getting off in the future).	I think your heads are kaput. If helicoils have been put in the heads, and now those have pulled out, it is time for new heads. I doubt the nut and bolt solution would work. Any failure of the head(s) could ruin the rest of the engine. <p>New heads aren't very expensive, and I think in your case it would be money well spent.	faq68 all	1

101	FAQ01 I'm running a Weber DFEV and 009. My weber carb seems to be jetted wrong. How do I adjust the DFEV carb? Should I keep my 009 distributor? If I go back to a 205 distributor, where do I connect the vacuum advance tube?	Before anything, you'll need to make sure your choke is adjusted.<p>I'm guessing that you have the electric choke (The E in DFEV is for Electric.) Adjust the choke with the engine off, and cold.<p>There are 3 small screws that hold the choke adjustment. It is a round thing, facing the fan shroud. It's kind of hard to get to. I usually use a combination of small sockets and distributor wrenches. Mark the housing the carb body with a Sharpie before you start adjusting, so you know where it used to be. Just loosen the three screws. I think you turn the electric choke housing the opposite direction that you want the choke plate to move. You'll have to open the the throttle for the choke plate to move freely. <p>When the engine is warm, the choke should be fully open. By the way, all those carb adjustments need to be done on a warm engine with the choke fully open.<p>The choke has an electric heating element in it, therefore you need to have a wire from the + of the coil to the connector on the choke.<p>Initial setup of a DFEV is tricky. You must do the jet and idle speed adjustments with the engine warmed up and the choke fully open.<p>Follow these basics: Back off the idle speed screw (on the linkage) until the throttle closes. Then turn the screw until it just touches. From there turn the screw exactly ONE turn. Start the engine, and allow it to warm up. Make sure the choke is all the way open. Now set the idle mixture for max rpm (presuming that the distributor and timing are exactly right). After all this, go back and use the idle speed screw (on the linkage) to set the idle speed to 900 or so. This is the correct way to set the mixture and usually cures most problems. <p>People tell me that the 009 is a good distributor. Before anything drastic, make sure your car is prefectly tuned, and that the carb is perfectly set. I'd guess that your idle mixture is off, and maybe you have a vacuum leak.<p>As of April 2001, my thinking is that flat spots in the accelleration are due to a cold intake manifold, and perhaps too much ignition advance. The optimum temperature for the intake manifold it probably well over 100 degrees F. I have both my heat riser and the stock air cleaner with warm air inlet from down by the pushrod tubes. The warm air connection to the air clean required building an adaptor for the stock air cleaner (which I've since found mail order). Sadly, this whole setup may not fit under the engine cover of a stock Bug. All this extra manifold heat makes a huge difference in cold wet weather. Before installing the heat my Bug wouldn't idle in 40 degee F rainy weather. Now it occasionally has some problems, but it warms up quicker, and nearly always has a nice, smooth idle and accelleration regardless of weather. I'm actually looking for more intake manifold heat.<p>Incidently, I removed my engine thermostat and cooling flaps. That was a big mistake.<p>If you have too much initial ignition advance, then you'll probably set the idle speed screw too low. This makes the transition from idle to just off idle not work correctly.<p>I had my Weber setup wrong, in large part due to too much initial ignition advance. Right now I'm running about 5 degrees before top dead center (BTDC) with a 205 single vacuum advance distributor.<p>Here is a little story: I had a Weber DFAV on my old Datsun 510. It always ran perfect! The 510 engine is an inline water cooled 1600 cc, overhead cam. The BIG difference is that the 510's intake manifold is heated with engine cooling water, and the manifold is only about 4 inches long. Between the engine coolant and being bolted directly to the cylinder head, the 510 manifold is probably 140 degrees F. I know it was too hot to touch. My 510 had something like a 170 degree thermostat, so the intake manifold was being heated by water at near 200 degrees F. The 510 had amazing power, and no flat spots. I also have a Weber DGAV on my BMW 2002. Runs like a charm. The intake is also heated, and is short and bolted directly to the head. Neither of these cars had heated intake air.<p>If you have your carb apart, check the float level. This was not a problem with my carb, but it's worth checking. The fuel level in the float bowl effects the fuel level on the emulsion tube. The emulsion tube works with the air bypass jet and seems to effect rate of fuel vaporization. This means that float level is pretty critical.<p>Jetting is difficult. I've read one of the weber manuals, "All About VW Performance Engines" from Hot VWs magazine. It's a complex process, and perhaps not necessary. Info about the books (and mail order places) is online at:<p> <a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a><p>The boots at the ends of the center manifold section often leak. Best to replace them with new urethane parts. Vacuum leaks cause bad running problems.<p>Keep your 009. If you wanted to go back to the 205, you want the venturi vacuum on the middle of the side of the carb. This vacuum is low at idle and goes up as engine speed increases. You can verify this with an inexpensive vacuum gauge.<p>On the other hand, manifold vacuum is high at idle and goes down at speed increases.<p>	all faq01 jet jets jetting idle idel carb carburettor carburretor progressive	1

103	FAQ88 I'd like to get off road in a Baja. What do I need to do to build my own Baja?	The list is long. There are a couple of good books. The fastest way to get off road in a Baja is to buy one someone has put the work into. Bajas are available in all parts of the US, but especially in California and other Western States. There seem to be lots of Bajas in Arizona around Phoenix.<p>Check out my book list at <a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a>. I own all these books.<p>Every Bug owner needs "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive" (also known as the Idiots Guide book). It was the first book I bought.<p>"Baja Bugs and Buggies" is great. "How to Build a Dune Buggy" is actually about building a sand rail. It's has large number of photos of every step.<p>Unless you spend the big $$, you'll have a more or less stock 1600 cc engine, and only 3 to 5 inches of lift. With good tires and a few beefed up suspension components this is more than sufficient to head offroad. Remember, there are almost stock Bugs that do the Baja 1000 race every year. One of the classes is allowed to change the tires and that's about all. That class (Class 1/2 as I recollect) also has to use single port heads!<p>By the way, when you buy a fiberglass Baja kit, get the 7 piece kit, and order the "extra thick" kit. There are many ripoff kits. As far as I know, the only good kit comes from Mark V Fiberglass products. They have a web site, and I'll try to dig up the URL soon.<p>	all FAQ88	1

When I bought my spray gun it was called an HVLP, however, their catalog doesn't list it that way anymore. It is a nice gun, made in China or Taiwan, and apparently a copy of more expensive spray guns. I'm happy with it.<p>I learned a couple of things:<p>Gravity feed is good, especially for smaller jobs and lower air flow.<p>When adjusting the spray gun, close down the paint nozzle adjustment. A smaller nozzle opening is good, especially for smaller jobs, or if you are using lower air flow. When the nozzle is open too far, you often get paint spatter.<p>It is possible to do some brush work, but you must use a very high quality artist brush. <p>I use plastic turkey basters (a plastic tube with a rubber bulb) to get a few ounces (100 ml or so) out of large paint thinner cans or paint cans.	faq30 all	1
106	FAQ 126: I get my license in 4 days! I need help custom: message: Ok my bug is running great and everything is working and ready for me to drive. But of course no defrosting! I dont have much time left, and i want to be able to drive it. Is there anything quick that i can do for the mean time? While I think of something for the long run.<p>I was thinking about installing a cigarette lighter, that <br>way i could buy one of those mini heater defroster things. Would that help? Or not even help at all? I would really appreciate your help....<p> Thanks Chris<br>	Chris,<br>The cigarette lighter thing probably won't do much.<p>If the heat exchangers are in good condition, and all the tubing that carries air is working, then you'll have "some" defrosting. After that you add fans. There are kits.<p>I have seen no complete heating system diagram for the Bug, and I've never had time to make one. Dang.<p>The air starts from the fan shroud, blows through the heat exchangers. There are flaps that open the heat exchangers. The "Heat" control inside the Bug controls those flaps. If the control is frobbed, you could just wire the flaps in the "heat" position.<p>After that a fat plastic pipe carries the air to the rear end of the heater channels under the rear seat. At the front of the heater channel there is a flex pipe in the A post of the door which comes out up in the luggage compartment. That flex hose attaches to the defroster vents.<p>All the hoses have to be in place and not leaking. It can help to block off the heat vents next to your feet so all the air goes to the defroster.<p>Parts are available.

107	FAQ25 I have a 1972 Beetle.  First of all, how do I tell what size/type engine do I have?  Secondly, how can I tell if the car is a SuperBeetle?  Thanks.	I'm not quite sure how to tell Beetle engine sizes. There is an engine number just below the generator/alternator stand. I don't have a table of those numbers, but I think I've seen some online. <p>It turns out that a US 1972 is almost certainly 1600 cc.<p>The Super Beetle has a deeply curved windshield, and Macpherson struts in the front end (instead of shock absorbers and torsion bars/ball joints). The normal Bug windshield is only slightly curved, and is only about 3 or 4 inches from the steering wheel.	faq25 all	1
108	FAQ28 Are all old vw bugs stick shift?<p>	Not really. There is an automatic transmission called an autostick. I've never driven one, and I'm not sure I've ever seen one. I've had email from a couple of autostick owners who like it. Parts are probably a little rare, although I'm pretty sure parts are still available.	faq28 all	1
109	FAQ83  I just bought a 1973 super beetle. It looks good and is said to run good. The only thing is the key is lost. So I will have to change the ignition cylinder out. I know that the steering wheel will have to come off. And then the turn signal comes off. After this it gets sort of fuzzy what to do next. I really want to hear this thing run. Can you help?<p>	I haven't done this repair, but the lock has to come off the steering column. Then there is a hole in the side of the ignition switch. Push a thin punch (or very stiff wire) in there, and the lock should release. There is some note about having to drill certain models with out the hole. I don't think that applies to the 1973 standard Beetle.<p>The process may be more involved if you are doing the cylinder, rather than just the switch part.<p>The shop manual has details of this repair. I've reviewed the shop manual online at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0837600960.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0837600960.html</a><p>I have had good luck ordering parts from Rock Mtn.

110	FAQ40 Almost every interior electrical system in my Bug doesn't work.  All my fuses are good and I'm stumped.	There is a main power feed to the fuse block from the rear of the car. It is a fat red wire. One major branch of that wire goes to the fuse block to power things that work when the ignition switch is off. The other main branch goes to the ignition switch, and returns to the fuse block. This powers things that only work when the ignition switch is on.<p>If you use a test lamp (available at tool, hardware, and auto supply stores) you'll find out where there is juice, and where there isn't. After that look for bad connections and broken wires.<p>When actually fixing wires, it is best to disconnect the NEG terminal of the battery. With the NEG off, the car's electrical system is safe (even when the positive terminal is still connected). This is true because the entire metal frame of the car is all negative. The only positive parts are wires connected somehow to the positive battery terminal. If you only disconnect the positive battery terminal, you can short circuit between the positive terminal and any metal part of the car.<p>	faq40 all	1
111	FAQ53 For my 16th birthday I have inherited a 1968 volkswagen beetle. From the first time I turned it on a light on the dash has light up. It kept me guessing for a little while until the car died, at which time I knew it was the generator. Please don't laugh. My family is not mechanically inclined at all and I was hoping to possibly pick up cars as a hobby. I would like to replace and install the generator myself rather than pay  to take it into a shop and fix it. A trusty retailer in my area has offered to sell me the generator and regulator for  together. Though everywhere I look I am meeting with confusion. I don't even know the key differences between a generator and and alternator or what the advantages or disadvantages each holds. Any help, guidance or direction you could offer to me would be greatly appreciated.	First a little safety tip: disconnect the NEGATIVE battery terminal before starting any electrical repairs.<p>You need John Muir's book "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive". It has step by step instructions for most common VW repairs. He doesn't cover converting to an alternator, but he does talk about the charging system.<p>See my review at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html</a><p>Get the book, and I think you'll be fine. <p>Does that alternator come with instructions?<p>Also, see my FAQ about alternator hookup. Not much there, but if the wire match, it's a pretty easy connection.<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s2=0&o=a&findme=alternator">http://laudeman.com/bug_faq/msearch.pl?s2=0&o=a&findme=alternator</a><p>Alternators use alternating current which can be generated more efficiently. They change the AC to DC with large diodes. Since they are more efficient, they provide power better at idle. Since they are AC, they don't have brushes so they last longer.<p>	faq53 all	1
112	FAQ 122: My bug will not turn over and will not start. I have replaced the battery and starter. All I hear is a click near the carb when the ignition key is turned to the starting position. The starter does not turn over, however, there is juice going to the starter. Could the problem be my ignition switch, coil, points and condensor or something else?<p>	The starter not turing over (when you know it is a good starter) is usually not enough juice (current) on the small red wire. That triggers the solenoid which closes the battery-to-start connection and turns the starter over.<p>It takes a fair bit of current to close the solenoid. If you touch the solenoid wire to the battery positive, does the starter turn? Do this carefully. Car out of gear, brake on, no fuel fumes, etc.<p>The ignition switch contacts go bad and don't send enough current to the solenoid. A DC circuit can have 12V, but a bad contact will prevent those 12V from flowing enough to close the solenoid or light a bulb. Putting in a Ford solenoid like I did helps, but it just delays replacing the ignition switch. I still have to push the key in while turning the ignition switch to get the starter to turn.<p>I had a case where a reverse switch tested OK with a voltmeter, but wouldn't pass enough current to light a bulb.<p>The click in the base of the carb is the idle solenoid, and that's normal.	all wiring crank faq122	1
113	FAQ42 How do I remove the front seats from my 72 super beetle? I have tried for days and have asked everyone I know, and no one can get them out.<p>	I've never looked at seats on older Bugs, but I read what is in the shop manual. Your 1972 probably has the older style seat rails. If there is a seat belt warning wire, disconnect that first. The shop manual recommends putting some cardboard on the floor in front of the seat.<p>Slide the seat all the way forward. Push down on that sheetmetal stop/catch. There may also be a spring to remove. Slide the seat a little further forward and lift up. It should come off the rails, and you can lift it out of the car.<p>If your seats are like my 1973 regular Beetle, it's not too hard. The seat has 3 mounting points. The two rear feet ride in rails and just slide back and forth.<p>The front mount is the latch, and has a sliding part. It also has a catch so you can't accidently push the seat back too far. The seat comes out be sliding it backward, but you have to push the catch down with a long flat bladed screwdriver while moving the seat back. This is tricky for one person.<p>It also helps to remove the catch. It is held in place with a single phillips head screw. Keep the catch and the screw.<p>If your seats are more like Rabbits and Golfs, there is still the three point mount, but the front stop is a little bolt, not a metal catch.<p>	faq42 all	1
114	FAQ22 I wanted to know if there is any chance and way to take off the roof and make it convertible, is this legal?<p>Maybe you know about a place in Israel where I can buy parts?<p>	It is very difficult to convert a normal sedan to a convertible. Convertibles (VW and other makes) have specially reinforced frames to compensate for the missing roof. The roof of a car adds a large amount of strength. You would be better off to search for a good convertible.<p>I don't know where to get parts in Israel. If you find out, please drop me a note. I'm trying to compile names, addresses and phone numbers of VW parts suppliers world wide.	faq22 all	1
115	FAQ46 One day I'm driving along happy as can be in my 1975 Super Beetle with a 1970 engine, and the generator light comes on. I go home turn the car off. I try again the next morning....and its off. It's happened repetedly now and its really started to concern me. My dad checked the generator and said that was fine and to just drive it. So ok fine, I drive it with the light still coming on faintly at times. Then oddly enough my gas gauge says I have no gas. So I go to the gas place put in like 2.00 and its full. Get back in the car and the gas gauge works again. Then last night I was driving in it and everytime I put my foot on the clutch the hand brake and oil light would come on.  And different lights keep going off on the car and staying on. I imagine its something electrical, but I wouldn't even know where to start. Any insight you could provide would be greatly appreicatd.	Intermittent problems are always the worst.<p>My first guess is a charging system problem, but I'm not sure how that could account for the oil light coming on. Is your Bug idleing too slow? Does the oil light go out when you give the car a little gas? Does the generator light only come on a low rpms? If so, just raise the rpm.<p>Aside from a problem with the charging system (probaby the regulator) it sounds like you've got a short. Rodents chew wires, and then things get messy. <p>Visually inspect wires first. Replace problem wires one at a time (so you can remember which wire goes where).<p>Next start with suspect circuits, and remove the wire from each end, and check for a short to ground. If a wire that isn't connected to anything has a short, pull it out and replace it with the same size, and hopefully a similar color wire.<p>A test lamp, and a VOM meter (volt-ohm-milliamp) is really handy. One of those  meters should be fine.<p>	faq46 all	1
116	FAQ13 How to I open the trunk of my late model Bug? The lever in the glove box is broken.	The VW shop manual recommends cutting the luggage compartment handle (trunk lid handle) in three places. With it cut, apparently it can be removed, or twisted around enough to get the lid open <p> You might call one of the VW mail order places (Kymco is my current favorite) just to see if they have a hint off hand. You can find their number, etc. at: <br> <a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a> <br> I have ordered from them 4 times, and gotten some advice that sounds good. Nice people. I just went out and looked at my car. The chances are slim, but I have some ideas: <p> If you think the cable is attached, but just inside the trunk, tear out the glove box (these are about  new, as I recollect, again Kymco can tell you). You would sacrifice the glove box, but that is pretty easy and cheap to fix. After that you might try: <p>1) Use some stiff wire and see if you can get the latch pushed back. This is a long shot, but doesn't require breaking anything. The latch is on the right (passenger) side, and moves towards the right. You'd have to put a hook in the wire, and slide it to the latch from the right (pass.) side, then rotate the wire. You're trying to hook it into a hole, and pull the hole towards the right (pass.) side. The hole is a collar that locks down the trunk lid. <p>2) Drill out the center of that little round thing below the front of the trunk lid. You may have to remove the bumper to get to it. This has a nut on the inside. You may have to destroy that little thing since it should come out from the inside. The latch is just above it, and I think the tire won't be too much in the way. A long (perhaps curved) pry bar should be able to push back the latch. Maybe even your fingers or hand. The down side is that the spare tire might be in the way.	all trunk latch faq13	1

I think only the Supers have a fan.<p>If you mean the only fan I can think of, yYou get to it from the front trunk area. Carefully remove the pressboard trim.<p>I suspect you'll have to replace the fan. I've pulled a Super Beetle fan and its housing apart.

I did get it open, and with some effort (I forget exactly what) I did get the fan off the motor shaft and oil the motor bearings.	all faq85	1
119	FAQ03 My floors are rusted out. Should I replace/repair them myself?	It is work, but you can do it. You'll have to buy a wirefeed or MIG welder. Don't bother with cheap stick welders - they burn sheetmetal. I'd recomment just getting a decent MIG (wirefeed with argon or some similar inert gas). Wirefeed is better than a cheap AC welder that uses welding rod, but plain old wirefeed still has flux in the wire, and the flux leaves slag on the weld. The flux also make a LOT of splatter. Save yourself much time and effort (all the slag has to be removed) and just get a MIG with the gas cylider.  I've got a Campbell-Hausfeld stick welder and the quality is good at a price about 1/2 of a Lincoln. Cost for the MIG and small gas cylinder (perhaps included with the welder should be less than .  There are instructions in one of the back issues of Hot VWs or VW Trends about floor pan replacement. I'm not sure which, and I'm not sure which issue. Both have email/web sites listed at: <a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a> Oh, you'll want to have friends to help lift the body off the car. Where will you store the body? Under a tarp is probably ok. You'll probably need to buy a few tools besides the MIG. Cutting the old pans can probably be done with a reciprocating saw, instead of a cutoff wheel on a grinder. It is a big job, no doubt. This makes me wonder how much a pristine floor pan that someone else had restored would be. That solution might cost extra, but would not require welding. I have seen pans used advertised for between  and . Is your body is good shape? No point in restoring the pan and leaving rusty hole in the body. Call someplace like Kymco and see what they advise. Also BTLMex.com may have restored pans. If you do it, let me know how things work out!	all faq03	1

Before getting in too deep, you should look at what people have done. Go to the VW car shows in your area, and subscribe to one or more of the air cooled VW magazines.

121	FAQ94 My son and I are restoring/building a baja bug. I'm having trouble finding a lift kit. I'm not sure what to use and body lift kit or a suspension lift kit. Any advice?	There are two kinds of lift for a bug: suspension mods to push the wheels down and the body up, and a body lift which is a steel channel that goes between the body and the pan to raise the body.<p>You can see suspension examples on my site.<p>Suspension lift is also described in the books like "Baja Bugs & Buggies" by Jeff Hibbard, edited by Ron Sessions. My review is at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0895861860.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_0895861860.html</a><p>Body lift doesn't increase ground clearance, but does increase tire to fender clearance. Tire to fender clearance isn't an issue until you have a very radical suspension, and such a radical suspension costs big $$$.<p>I'd recommend the usual mild mods plus bigger tires, and drive it off road for a while to see if you need more mods.<p>	all faq94	1
122	FAQ51 If I install an ammeter I'll need an extra hot wire to the battery positive. What is the best way to add that additional wire?	I usually use battery terminals that have a screw clamp for the wire. Since I almost always need a second lighter gauge wire to/from the charging system, I just clamp both wires together under the clamp on the terminal.<p>Quality terminals are available at auto supply stores and battery supply stores. I'm still fond of brass battery terminals.<p>	faq51 all	1
123	FAQ09 - What size engine should I put in my Baja Bug? What kind of bolt on horse power can I get?	The most reliable, fuel efficient engine for a Bug will be a 1600 with some modern improvements (balanced crank, hydraulic lifters, oil filter, dog house oil cooler, electronic points, merged exhaust header, alternator, 3 angle valve job) with the stock carburetor. Read the "All About Performance VW Engines" book mentioned below and you'll see that the most horsepower from a 1600 cc engine at 3500 rpm is actually the stock 34PICT-3 carb on a larger manifold (apparently only available from CB Performance). So called "bolt on horsepower" only applies at engine rpms over 5000! My Beetle never gets over 4500, so none of that stuff would help. Yes, read the dyno tests and you'll see that in normal driving the stock carb has more horsepower than any dual carb setup! <p> The Weber DFAV carb has very slight power gains, but is a pain to tune. My engine has never run as well with the Weber as with the stock carburetor. Mostly the poor running is dumb stuff: the choke on the Weber is very poor, so either my car almost dies at idle when it is cold, or the choke doesn't open soon enough. Even when the car is hot the idle varies. For no reason the car will idle so slow it almost dies. I'm pretty sure that the secondary throttle plate sticks open a tiny bit unless I punch the gas pedal.<p> Real horsepower you can use means HP at 4000 rpm and lower. The only true way to increase that is to have a larger engine. People tell me that 1776 is reliable. When you start getting to 1900 and 2000 cc sizes, the engine case (what is called the engine block in water cooled cars) has to be machined, and while these engines can be bullet-proof, it's a lot more $$.<p> Check out the book:<p> "All About VW Performance Engines" from Hot VWs magazine. This is great, and includes dynomometer tests of about 40 engine configurations. Anyone customizing an engine must buy this book. Along with all the other wonderful stuff it has details on how to tune (and set the jets) on the Weber DFEV / DFAV carb.<p> You could just keep your stock engine, add the CB manifold, merged header, electronic ignition (I have a CompuFire) and see how you like it. The later engines (69 and later) have the larger oil cooler, and better oiling system in the case. This is essentially Class 1500 Baja racing and those racers blast through the Baja 1000 and other offroad races all the time. Of course they don't win overall (that goes to the high $$$ trophy trucks), but they finish which is more than you can say for modern vehicles in other classes!	engine carb distributor points stinger cam cylinder heads faq09	1

126	FAQ34 I bought a 74 standard beetle last year and I'm learning a lot. I have a problem with the suspension. When I bought it the previous owner had the front replaced and said that the tough ride was because it was new and had to "break in". Well it never did, I replaced the shocks with Brazilian shocks to se if can soften it but had no luck. When you push down on the front you get no movement at all. also when I raised the car on the hoist the front wheels droped about 4 inches as the car came up. Is their a wrong way to install the torsion bars or the front axle? Do I simply have to replace the front axle again?	This sounds normal. The front end of the Bug is very light, but the suspension is kind of hard. Mine is like this but I only notice it on big bumps. Of course, mine has 27 years of wear on it. <p>If you put in the stock torsion bar packs, then it should be OK. I've heard of people removing one of the segments of one or both front torsion bars. I'm not sure how well that works, and it may require an adjustable front torsion bar tube to maintain ride height.<p>Are your tires over inflated? Recommended front Bug tire pressure is much lower than normal cars.<p>Try to join the local VW club, and ask some other owners their experience, or drive their cars to compare.<p>	faq34 all	1

Well, they were just fine, so I put new covers on, and put all back in order, and ......she wouldn't start. There were a few times that she started, and just putted out. Luckily, my neighbor stopped by and we proceded to check the spark from the plugs, coil, and wires. All was in order. We even took out a plug (new as of two months ago) and it was fine. However, the spark was not making it to the distributor, which was also changed two months ago. There seems to be a bit of play on the post like thing that the rotor sits on, at least 1/4 in. and I don't recall if that's good, or normal. Also, the fuse was burnt, adn that means that something burnt it. So, that left the new dist. cap, and the fuel pump. I wanted to take the pump apart, but what was in my "idiots guide" [ The Muir book: How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive] was not what I was looking at, and therefore, I couldn't."	My reply wasn't too useful, but Jenny tracked down the problem and writes:<p>"I had a super old distributor in the car, probably the original, and it's cap was loose, and so its timing was going out at every little bump that was hit, so I replaced it with a newer distributor, one of those advanced vaccuum ones, and it was the end of the problem."<p>Thanks Jenny!	all dist spark miss hesitate faq118	1
128	FAQ32 How much does it cost to change the front brakes to disc brakes, and is it adviseable?	Price seems to start around  USD for front disc systems. Rear disc with an emergency brake is seems to be more like . I only know from reading advertising in the VW magazines. \r\n\r\nThe VW discs on Karman Ghias are actually heavier (in pounds or grams) than the stock drums. The disc will have better stopping. Modern discs are lighter than the drum brakes.\r\n\r\nMy Bug could use better brakes, but if I have a panic stop (very fast, and as hard as I can press on the brake pedal) my front tires skid! Never the back. All the weight in a Bug is in the rear, unlike most other cars.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that brakes are kind of complex, and until I can find an expert, or spend about  experimenting, I'll just keep my drum brakes. Maybe I'll look for a modern brake shoe. Keep in mind that carbon-metallic brakes do not work well when cold (which is most of your braking).\r\n\r\n	faq32 all brakes disk rotor	1

140	FAQ103 I have a friend witha 76ish beetle and he wantsw to get new seats. are there any better seats from another car that would bolt in instead that are better than the ones he has?<p>Thanks	Some off road seats bolt in, but they don't adjust or recline. There are kits to replace the padding and upholstery. Recaro may make something, but those are usually expensive (more than ?).<p>I bought aftermarket seat rails as a kit. It was about  for both sides. I think I got the seat rails from Latest Rage. Usually people get one forward and backward adjustable seat rail for the driver side, and a non-adjustable folding seat rail for the passenger side. <p>I cut the rear legs and the center mount off of some later (around 1985-1990) Golf/Jetta seats that I picked up from the junkyard (between  and  depending on the quality of the seat). Then I use some U bolts (5/16 diameter, about 2 inch curve) to bolt the seat to the seat rail.<p>I've been very happy with this. It does raise the seats a couple of inches, so there is a little less clearance between your legs and the steering wheel. I'm 5' 8" tall and it isn't a problem. You may have to notch the front right corner of the Golf/Jetta seat so that you can shift into reverse when the seat is forward.  The upholstery is easy to work with on the later model seats. I just removed the upholstery covering (buy cutting the bull rings), and cut 2 to 4 inches off the front right seat pad.<p>By the way, instead of "bull rings" to secure the upholstery, I use heavy gauge plastic wire ties, and cut off the excess (also called zip ties).<p>All Golf/Jetta seats from around 1990 recline, and can fold up. Even if they don't have the folding handle, it is pretty easy to install a cable through the latches. I used small (1/16 inch) cable, and crimp on aluminium stops. Worked great.	all faq103 upholstry	1

145	FAQ86 Just sold my last sandrail and am wanting to get into a Baja that is built, pretty and ready to party. Any suggestions?	I don't know of any Baja's up here in Virginia. Get something rust free, and not too radical. The more radical machines probably won't hold up as well off road.<p>I like later model Bugs with the IRS. I do not like the Weber DFEV for the Beetle, and I'm pretty sure that single, center mounted carbs won't perform well as a daily driver in cooler climates. For that, dual carbs are probably better.<p>I have my DFEV running well, but it requires heating the intake air, and it still has a tiny hesitation. As I write this (October 2001) I'm about to buy a nice dual carb setup. I'll almost certainly get dual single barrel carbs (Solex - Kadrons, or Webers).	all faq86 sand rail test8\r\n	1
147	FAQ75 Great Web site!!! I Purchased a 74 Baja Bug from an individual. Every thing is in good solid cond.and the Baja kit although off another car, and has been installed pretty well. My problem is ... it had no motor! However, a friend who owns a junk yard gave me a type 3 engine out of a station wagon.   He told me the car was running when it made its last journey to his yard, but since then the car has been crushed. I've rescued the motor and checked it out thoroughly. It turns over freely and seems to have good compression. The trouble is it is a fuel inj. motor 2. What changes do I need to make besides putting a carburetor on and changing the cooling sys? i.e. fan shroud tins etc.\r\n\r\nAny help on this would be greatly apreciated since I'm on a limited buget after spending .00 on the car.	Why change the fuel injection (FI)? The Bosch FI is solid, gives more power (than stock) and better fuel mileage than any carburetor. It should be totally immune to flooding from bouncing over rough terrain. \r\n\r\nGiven the touble I've had with my Weber DFAV (and with the original PICT carb) I've been thinking seriously of putting the Bosch FI on my Baja! People say the system is not too hard to understand - as long as you have a shop manual.\r\n\r\nYou might as well keep the type 3 cooling as well. As far as I know it works fine. As I recollect the type 3 runs the fan directly from the crankshaft. This means that if the fan belt goes, you loose the charging system, but you can still run the car (off the battery) because the fan will still work.	faq75 all stuff more stuff	1

180	FAQ90 I just purchased a 66 Baja from friends. Unfortunately they are mechanically challenged and know nothing. Well, when I got into it I found a crack in the block and now it will run, as it back fires,and fills up the cab and the outside world with smoke. I am just wondering if you can help me. I have never owned a bug before and I am trying to figure things out. But I am mechanically inclined, so I can do most of the work myself.<p>	That's a sad story, but I think it will have a happy ending.<p>The cracked block is probably scrap. Even if it could be welded, they aren't worth the cost to fix. VW Bug engine cases are a magnesium alloy, very tricky to weld.<p>So, you need a good used engine (unless you have deep pockets and want to spring for a rebuilt - for rebuilt engines contact some of the suppliers listed at my Parts page). You can put it in yourself, or get a shop to do it. Labor from a shop may run , maybe less, maybe more. It sounds like you'll do the work yourself. Baja's are much easier to work on due to the exposed engine.<p>A reputable scrapyard should have several engines. Get something that isn't covered with oil, and which hasn't been steam cleaned. When the engine is steam cleaned it's pretty, but you can't tell a thing about it. Price will probably be between  and  for the engine. Shop around a bit to make sure you get a good deal. Usually the shops can tell you the mileage on the engine, how it ran, did it smoke, etc.<p>Then you need the 'idiots guide' written by John Muir. The real title is "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive". It covers <p>many repairs, including an engine swap. See my online review at:<p><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html</a><p>Go to my home page, and search the FAQ. You'll need to check/replace many rubber parts like fuel lines.

181	I'm having a difficult time removing the rear axle nut in order to remove the hubs to replace the brake shoes and wheel cylinders on a 1969 VW Bug.  Any suggestions on removal?	Both nuts are normal thread - turn counter-clockwise to remove. I checked the Muir book to be sure (and that's what I remember although I've only had mine off once).<p>Before removing the nut, mark it with some paint on the nut and the spindle so you can tighten it back to the same place. Remove the cotter pin.<p>There are two common ways: buy a 36mm hub socket (which will be 1/2 inch drive). Front wheel drive spindle sockets are usually available at places like AutoZone and Sears. Get a 1/2 inch drive breaker bar and attach a cheater (piece of pipe). Get someone to sit in the car with the brakes on, and you basically put all your weight (carefully) on the cheater. You'll probably have to stand on the cheater, and bounce. Needless to say, you need a really strong breaker bar.<p>The second method is a little simpler. there's a 36mm wrench-like tool with flat surfaces for hammering where the handle would normally be. It's only about 6 inches long and you pound on it with a hammer. Works great. It's only a few dollars from any VW parts supplier.<p>Of course, there is one more way: get a big, powerful air impact wrench, set it at max and back the nuts off. I have a  40 dollar air wrench rated at 275 foot pounds at 90 psi. I had to set the compressor to at least 90 psi and it still took almost a minute of the wrench hammering away before the nuts started to back off. That uses a TON of air so a small compressor has trouble keeping up.<p>Get the Muir book. Fantastic. It describes the breaker bar method, and even has an amusing illustration.<p>"How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive"\r\nMy review:\r\n<a href"http://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html">\r\nhttp://laudeman.com/bug_b_1562614800.html</a><p>BTW, while you have the rear drums off, it might be wise to just replace the rear wheel cylinders. I think new cylinders are only about  each, and you don't want to have to go back in there due to a leaking wheel cylinder.<p>Drop me a note if your brakes feel soft after bleeding. I have some ideas.\r\n	all vw rear drums hubs nut bolt brake drum axle faq216	1
10	FAQ74 Can I convert my Baja Bug back to a regular Bug? It was a Baja when I got it but I would like to convert it back. Is that posible? If it is do you know any books or web sites that could help me?	This would be difficult. The front and rear aprons were cut off, so you've have to do some very tricky body work (welding) to replace the aprons, and then you'd have to refit the trunk lid and engine cover. I'd recommend selling the Baja to someone who wants one, and getting a nice, rust free Bug.<p>	faq75 all stuff	1
84	FAQ77 I have a 1960 baja Bug. I think it has a Bus transaxle with gear boxes at the wheels. It sits at positive camber. Do you know how or know someone who knows how to fix this. My Bug has knobby tires on it and I can see the uneven wear. I got the Bug as is, so I don't know what I've got.	The only fix for too much rear camber is to lower the rear until the camber is normal. There are camber limiters, but all they do I keep the wheels from dropping too much when the Bug flys over bumps.<p>To get the rear end of a Bug really jacked up, you have to replace the spring plates with special trailing arms. <p>The problem is worse on swing axle rear ends (any Bug made before about 1969). The so-called IRS (independent rear suspension) has axles and CV (constant velocity) joints so it has less camber problems than the swing axles. Still, just from eyeballing my rear end, I can't get more than about 12 degrees angle on the axles.<p>If it is any comfort, class 1/2 Bugs run the Baja 1000 all the time. Just about the only mods they are allowed is larger tires.	all faq77 $100	1
85	FAQ 123 Where can I get a Honda sissy bar like the one pictured on your Honda Shadow VLX?	Nanci kindly writes: <p>I paid  + shipping ( total) for the sissy bar/backrest which I purchased on eBay. But, I also received part numbers from the local Honda dealer here (Al's Honda - Bellingham, WA 360-733-1000) and was quoted a fairly reasonable price of  - not bad for a dealer. Here are the part numbers: 08111-MR100 & 08111-MR150. <p>Unfortunately, I have know idea who the manufacturer might be but possibly you could coerce that information out of them.<p>Thanks Nanci!	motorcycle sissybar back rest backrest 123 faq123 $100	1

105	FAQ100 I'm considering buying a 1990-1993 VW Cabriolet. I was wondering if you have any advice / caution about this model?\r\n\r\nAre they generally reliable?\r\n\r\nDo they make a good buy? Do they age well?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of mechanical problems are they likely to have? Are there any questions that I should make sure to ask the seller?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!	Good questions. My girlfriend and I bought a 1991 Cabrio. It is a great car, and has aged pretty well. She drives the car every day and loves it. Her 1991 is still the Rabbit body style, although it seems to have the later Digifant EFI (electronic fuel injection). I think the body style is early \r\n\r\nbecause Karmen makes these cars and doesn't get the new styles until they have been out for a few years. My 1989 Golf is the later body style, but has very similar EFI to the 1991 Cabrio.\r\n\r\nMost problems are small, but I'm going to have to completely disassemble the dashboard. That will be time consuming. I \r\n\r\nthink a new wiper/washer switch is about . I don't know what other parts will be required, but I'm not expecting too \r\n\r\nmuch. I may have to get a used heater control unit from the junkyard. This is the thing that controls the vacuum that opens and closes the various vents.\r\n\r\n- It has some typical small VW electrical problems. The instrument lights keep going out probably due to a short under the dashboard, and the windshield washer switch isn't \r\n\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n- The vacuum controlled heater/ac vents don't all work.\r\n\r\n- There is a water leak under the dashboard.\r\n\r\n- We replaced the door vapor barriers because they were leaking (there are photos of this procedure on my web site).\r\n\r\n- These cars have more engine vibration than the later Golf/Jetta/Cabrio. My 1989 is the later type is has less vibration.\r\n\r\n- If the roof is in good shape, it works well. It can have air leak (a kind of roaring noise over 50 mph which comes from the joint between the roof and the top of the windshild). This can be cured to a great extent by making the roof latches tighter.\r\n\r\n- The front door windows will leak if left open even a tiny bit. \r\n\r\n- The passenger window catches at the rear about 2 inches from being closed. It helps to gently push out on the top rear corner of the window while closing it.\r\n\r\n- The upper strut bearings often need replacement. Our car has some play here, which makes the front end clunk. The parts were inexpensive, and although I haven't replaced them yet, it looks like a pretty easy job. Some play at the top of the strut is normal\r\n\r\n- Perhaps due to the engine mount system, the 1991 Cabrio has more engine vibration transmitted to the passenger compartment than my 1989 Golf. I know that the front mount on the Cabrio is broken, and that may be a factor.\r\n\r\n- Older VWs often need a radiator, maybe around 100K miles.\r\n\r\n- These cars have quite a bit of belt noise, but everything works fine.\r\n\r\n- Check the transmission in all gears. My Golf is great still at over 160K miles, however the Cabrio is on it's second transmission.\r\n\r\nFor a long checklist that I wrote about the BMW 2002 and which applies to most cars see:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://laudeman.com/bmw_checklist.html">http://laudeman.com/bmw_checklist.html</a>\r\n\r\n	all faq100 stuff	1
146	FAQ111 How-do!<br><br>I have a '72 Superbeetle that I built from parts three years ago and got rear ended in yesterday. I was ably to pry the sheet metal out of the main pully and limp it on home, but now I'm not sure what to do.<br><br>Providing the frame isn't too bent to realign everything, it may be too cost-prohibitive to stragighten the parts that the bumpers, rear parts of the fenders, and that skirt thing attaches to. I don't really want one but I might have to bob the tail to save the car. I have never considered it before, though I guess I can go about taking notes on what others have done. Is there a standard method for doing a tail-ectomy?<br><br>Secondly, it is a Super. I have never heard of them being made into Bajas because of the front ends. Any advice you can give me will be welcome.<br><br>In the meantime I do have my pickup truck and I'll have my motorcycle back on the road in a couple of weeks. Thanks for the time and trouble.<br><br>Will, Norfolk, Virginia	Supers can be made into Bajas. Raising the front is different, but I think you can get a few extra inches. Besides, more ground clearance is not a requirement for a Baja. There are tons of street Bajas.<br><br>Over all, it might be the same amount of work to just replace the rear valance, if indeed that is the only thing bent. They are available. Check out parts suppliers that I list at:<br><br><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_orders.html"> http://laudeman.com/bug_orders.html</a><br><br>Books on Baja conversions are good. The classic is "Baja Bugs and Buggies":<br><br><a href="http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html">http://laudeman.com/bug_links.html</a><br><br>If you do get a Baja kit, get it from Mark V Fiberglass. I have never heard of a Baja kit from another source that was any good. The "Baja kit" is between 5 and 7 alternate body parts. You still have to supply the front and rear tubular cage thingies (called Baja bumpers).	all faq111 parts racing fiberglass nose	1
