Deft is deft2perl.pl which compiles Deft sources into Perl executables. 

The project is under development and the current version is not working.

Deft is declarative table-oriented programming. Each statement is executed for every row of a first-normal form table. Variables are columns in the table. For non-aggregating operations, each row is independent and operating on a row is side-effect free. Aggregation operations effect all rows.
