Introduction
------------

This is the third draft. Detailed explanation is still developing, as
is the glossary.  The math concepts require further illumination and
clarification, although they are quite well developed and supported by
a copious set of references. Deft was invented and implemented by Tom
Laudeman and Noah Healy. Please excuse the simple formatting. We see
little gain from creating a visually stimulating HTML document when
the document's purpose is technical exposition. Nonetheless, when
required, more visually interesting formatting will come with the
addition of a Deft template and Cascading Style Sheets.



Deft is TOP
-----------

Deft is a table oriented programming (TOP) computer language with
declarative execution. Deft has data parallelism. The uses of Deft are
primarily data manipulation and reporting. Deft source compiles to
Perl. The compiler is Perl and statement syntax is essentially
Perl. Deft relies on SQL (especially Postgres) to support a variety of
non-core API reporting features. Deft has its own templating solution
which is tailored toward HTML output. The novel templates are both
very powerful and very easy to use. There is no code in the
templates. Deft is strongly supportive of the Model View Controller
(MVC) coding style.



Deft is monadic
---------------

Even though Deft does not have monads per se, monadic actions are
inherent to the execution model in Deft. I/o and functional
transformations are all automatically monadic because the function is
applied to each record in the table. Monadic behavior is
unavoidable. Since all operations are monadic, even ostensibly
imperative statements become functional. 

Deft has functional composition via shared variables between
imperative statements. When two statements have at least one common
variable, the final result (the table) is "composed" by several
function calls.

The downside is that we have to create dummy variables since functions
cannot take functions as arguments (yet).  However, even this apparent
limitation has an upside. Deft's simplistic method allows a blend of
variables to be moved between functions.



Deft is declarative
-------------------

Deft is declarative much like Perl's "grep" or "map" functions or SQL
statements. Unlike SQL, Deft is Turing complete. The TOP aspect of
Deft is that essentially the only data structure is the column (in
concert with an implied table) The columns exist in an implicit
table. The table is essentially a non-ordered first normal form
table. Merely referring to a column instantiates that column in the
current scope. Deft is lexically scoped. Functions take columns as
arguments. With a small set of supporting syntactical sugar, the first
normal table is superior to traditional structs or classes. Any
arbitrarily complex data structure is easily represented by a first
normal form table.

Each statement operates on a record set and produces a record set as
output, although the input and output are implied. There is no need
for looping (for, while) since execution is declarative. Side effects
are nearly nil. Due to the single data structure (the table) there can
be no errors of passing the wrong struct. (Although it is quite
possible to pass an incorrect structure imputing column. More on how
structure is imputed later.) These three aspects eliminate many of the
sources of error (bugs) inherent to traditional computer
languages. SQL has minimal row-wise interaction, being limited to
operations such as 'group by' and 'sort'. Deft includes
sorting-aggregation functions that obviate the need for a traditional
'sort'. SQL 'group by' is rarely required in a Deft program



The table
---------

During the process of implementing Deft and researching the history of
data structures, we found many interesting (and largely unknown or
ignored) aspects of the non-ordered, first normal form table (which
will henceforth be referred to simply as "the table"). We also often
refer the table as "the stream" since conceptually it is "streamed"
from one line of Deft to the next. We use the term "record" in the
usual sense of a row in a table. Deft variables are columns in the
table, or cells in the record. However, since Deft only deals with
single records, the terms "column" and "variable" ( in the sense of a
scalar) are interchangeable. Deft has no other data types, and in
keeping with Perl's conventions, typing is weak. Noah is fond of
referring to a column as a "multi-valued variable" where each value is
in a separate record.

Conceptually, a Deft table is a two dimensional array. We will
probably always retain this conceptual view of the data, although the
actual implementation is almost certain to change. (The table is
currently implemented as a list of hashes with some ancillary
bookkeeping variables.) Typically, people avoid first normal form due
to the data repetition, as well as seeming difficulties in managing the
data. Contrary to this commonly held opinion we have found that first
normal form is easy to use and powerful. The missing piece of the
puzzle are a small set of functions which make working with the table
easy and intuitive.



Record independence
------------------

First normal gives us record independence. A single record is
complete, and the order of the records is not important. Records have
no knowledge of other records. Records are required not to know or
care about other records. Relational data is flattened as specified by
the programmer (Deft does joins by performing matrix multiplication,
which sounds nasty but turns out to be efficient and simple). Data
manipulation processes are only concerned with the current record. We
have realized a 3 to 1 reduction in number of lines of code compared
to Tom's rather verbose Perl. Fewer lines of code is good. An
excellent paper by Moseley and Marks shows that the theoretical
minimum for a Deft program is the square root of the number of lines
in a traditional language such as Java.

The table is inherently amenable to parallel operations due the the
independence of records (data independence; more on this below).  The
current version of Deft is single tasking, but we have older versions
which were capable of parallel operation (our implementation was crude
and slow, but worked). Deft algorithms and code are identical for both
single and parallel versions. There is no need for the programmer to
provide an extra layer of management for the parallel code.



Aggregation functions
---------------------

When working with the table, it is necessary to have some
"aggregation" functions. For example, in Deft we have the function
"dcc" (mnemonic: declare control column) which creates a control
column for Deft templates. The control column tells the template API
which records to render, and what their order will be. The internal
workings of dcc are moderately complex, but the function is simple to
use. Some common aggregation functions are sum, min, max, and
count. Our work so far shows that a small library of aggregate
functions is capable of handling nearly all programming needs. A large
portion of common tasks is handled by the function "desc" (mnemonic:
declare explicit structure column). The current implementation of Deft
includes additional aggregation functions which serve more as high
level tools: an SQL wrapper, a search engine, and the template
rendering function.

While the purpose of aggregation operations requires them to have
internal state information, all other types of Deft statements have no
stateful behavior. This leads to fewer bugs, and faster development
time.

Record independence means that each step of a manipulation can be
performed sequentially by separate processes chained together. The
process of developing a Deft program is an accretive behavior where
lines of code are added to build a desired data set. This type of
compositional programming lends itself to breaking the problems into
small, easily manageable conceptual blocks.



Compositional data structures
-----------------------------

Data structure is imputed onto the table by adding one or more
columns. This process is intuitive. Creating the aggregation functions
to support imputed data structure was an interesting
challenge. However, so far this process only requires one or two
generalized functions. Deft has none of the complexity of traditional languages involved
with managing data structures. There are not issues with creating
references to data, nor to de-referencing pointers, etc.

We theorize that many of these aspects of TOP explain why it has not
been more thoroughly explored by modern computer language
designers. That said, essentially all of our "discoveries" have been
previously reported.



Reporting, templates, and flattening
------------------------------------

We have created an execution and report rendering
environment where record order is meaningless until the data is
flattened and rendered for human consumption. Explicit order
necessary for rendering a report is handled by special aggregation
functions that create control columns in the data set. A report can
represent the data in several orderings if necessary without
duplicating the data for each ordering. This capability is so
difficult in other computer languages that data is simply
duplicated. An example is using two SQL queries when the records are
required to have two different orderings. 



A simple example
----------------

As an example imagine a conference schedule. The conference has
'topics' each of which has one or more 'speakers', so that we have a
simple relational model. To create the web page of the conference
schedule it will take several lines of Deft code (here represented as
meta code, with lines numbered for clarity.) This example assumes
there is a database with two tables: "topic", and "speaker". Topic
contains time, title, room number, and speaker contains name, title,
affiliation, email address. Since there can be several authors per
topic, we have a one-to-many relationship between the tables.

1. select topics (select * from topics)
2. select speakers for each topic (select * from speakers where topic
foreign key = topic primary key found in the stream)
3. create a control column for unique topics, sorted by time
4. create a column of unique authors and topic, sort by author last name
5. render a template (using the two columns we created)

Lines 1 and 2 use SQL. Deft knows how to talk to databases, using Perl
DBI. 

Line 2 will cross multiply the number of topics by the number of
speakers per topic. From a table-centric or data-structure-centric
view this may seem like a waste of space to duplicate
records. In reality, it consumes very little memory or bandwidth. More
importantly, each record is complete and can be handled independently
of other records. It is easy to imagine an implementation in Deft that
was conceptually first normal, but which did not duplicate the
data. This is a future development since all applications to date
perform quite well.

Lines 3 and 4 are necessary as a prelude to the rendering step. Based
on the requirements (i.e. unique topic), line 3 creates a new column with special
encoding expected by the rendering engine. This column contains a string that tells if
a record will be emitted in the rendering step, and what order it
should be rendered in. Lines 3 and 4 are interchangeable in order. It
is important that line 4 requires both unique author and topic. In our
example, topics create a new row in the HTML output, and authors are
listed within that row (perhaps even in table cells). This
relationship must be spelled out in the control column created by
statement 4, and is therefore explicit. The relationship is also
mirrored by a control column specifier in the HTML source. 



The Deft template engine
------------------------

The template understands that there are two control columns, and if
those columns would be nested, it also understands the nesting. No
other information is required by the template.

The template designer must create a row in the template for the topic,
and author must be 'inside' that row. The rendering engine outputs
rows based on control columns in the table. The specification of the
control columns and template are part of the specification of the
final web page. We envision that the template creation will often be
carried out by a HTML expert who may know nothing of databases (and
doesn't need to) while the Deft script is created by a DBA or
programmer who knows nothing about HTML and design (and doesn't need
to). As long as certain core aspects of the specification are
followed, changes to either the Deft script or the HTML template are
totally independent. This is a very pragmatic separation of roles
envisioned by MVC.

The template is 100% pure standard HTML that will render in any
browser, and is editable by any web editor. This is a nice aside for
template designers. The designer doesn't need the final program in
order to develop the template since the template itself is a valid
document. (This is not true of traditional php web pages which are not
MVC compliant, nor it is true of nearly all other template systems.)
The template contains loop control sections. However, we've devised an
easy way to put the loop controls in the HTML content, not inside tags
or attributes (even when attributes need to be controlled by the data
stream).

We have working, mature, production quality, data driven, search
engine based, web sites driven by Deft scripts with less than 10 lines
of Deft code.

We go into greater detail about the Deft template system in other
documentation.
