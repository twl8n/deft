      This document explains how looped areas of templates are created in Deft templates. We assume a working knowledge of HTML. <br>
      <br>
The simplest Deft templates have no loops and only colums substituted
into the template. Columns are denoted with Perl style variables e.g.
$variable. Only scalars are allowed. If a variable does not occur in
the data record, it will be left in the template undisturbed (this
allows templates to be used as templates).<br>
<br>Looping in Deft is controled by special columns in the data. Deft
control columns are created by&nbsp; the Deft programmer using the
special aggregation function
dcc(). The memnonic for "dcc" is "declare
control column". As far as the templates are concerned, it isn't
important how dcc() works, just that such a column will work correctly
with the template. There is a special part of the Deft template called
the "loop control" which describes what portion of the template is
controlled by each control column. Loop controls are surrounded by { }
and must have a control column as the first thing inside the { }.<br>
      <br>
The example below has two control columns: $distinct_t and $distinct_dt
(respectively "distinct title" and "distinct title/description"). <br>
      <br>
There are limits to the valid locations of various kinds of data and tags in HTML. In keeping
with HTML coding rules, start and stop strings in the control specs are
URI encoded. &lt; becomes &amp;lt; and &gt; becomes &amp;gt; This is
the type of encoding that your HTML editor will use. If you aren't
using an HTML editor you might choose to skip the encoding, although
your raw template may not render in a web browser. Deft templates are 100% HTML
compliant when encoding is used.<br>
      <br>
The first control spec is "{$discinct_t start &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; -2
stop &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; +4}". The table below has a breakdown of the
parts of the loop control.<br>

      <br>
To reiterate, a control loop is surrounded by { } and it has a
controling column, as well as start and stop locations within the
template. That's really it. <br>
      <br>
Below is an example using the second loop control which is highlighted
blue box. Incidently, the second loop is "inside" the first loop. <br>
      <br>
Starting at the second loop control statement "{$distinct_dt start
&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; -2 stop &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; +2}" and working
backward (left, up) I've labeled four positions around each &lt;tr&gt;.
Matches occur on both sides of &lt;tr&gt;. In the example below we are
counting backward, so the markers have negative numbers. When you get
to a &lt;tr&gt; the first side we encounter is -1, and after we pass
&lt;tr&gt; you are at -2. The first side of the next &lt;tr&gt; is -3,
and after passing &lt;tr&gt; we are at -4. <br>
      <br>
The example loop control below goes backwards to -2. I labeled -3 and -4 only to illustrate where these occur.<br>
      <br>
Going forward from the loop control, we see that the stop matches
&lt;/tr&gt; and will go to +2. We first encounter &lt;/tr&gt; at +1,
and after passing &lt;/tr&gt; we are at position +2.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dcc1.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      <br>
      </div>
      <br>
Keeping all that in mind, the blue area below highlights the portion of
the template controlled by the second loop control. The loop is&nbsp; one
&lt;tr&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt; tag, or one row in the table. Everytime this
control column ($distinct_dt) has a new distinct value, it will create another row in the
table.<br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dcc2.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
Building on what we've done so far, the two loops are highlighted
below. The outer loop is green, and the inner loop in blue. Notice that
both loops end in the same location. This is fine. Loops can contain
other loops. However, loops can't over lap in such a manner that part of a loop is
inside and part outside. <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dcc3.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Below is a second example as review. For this example, we will use the first loop control hightlighted in the image below.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dcc6.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      </div>
      <br>
In the image below the start section is highlighted. The start match is &lt;tr&gt; and is -2. We count backwards
to the left side of &lt;tr&gt;.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="dcc4.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Using the same example, in the image below, the
stop match is &lt;/tr&gt; and we count forward +4. That takes us to
the location marked in the image on the right side of the lower
&lt;/tr&gt;. We have passed two &lt;/tr&gt; tags, and since we count
the first and second positions at each tag, we get to +4 after the
second &lt;/tr&gt;.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="dcc5.jpg" border="1" height="400" width="680"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><br>
      </div>
